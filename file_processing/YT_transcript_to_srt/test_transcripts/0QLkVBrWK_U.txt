747.99 751.20	this you do like some kind of jest just
751.20 758.64	after I think this is great almost half
758.64 760.14	of those in Singapore's creative
760.14 762.87	industries are freelancers with no fixed
762.87 766.32	income but with all events in classes
766.32 769.20	cancelled since April workers like
769.20 772.26	Michelle must find other ways to earn
772.26 775.80	money so that I can finally call my
775.80 777.78	students you know and get them on for
777.78 785.07	online lessons yeah we have called
785.07 787.71	global apparently right the market has
787.71 795.67	expanded yeah we tried it
795.67 801.73	[Music]
801.73 805.22	yeah okay that's better
805.22 807.32	then less I was initially concerned
807.32 809.30	about my senior students because they
809.30 812.75	are not as tech savvy as the younger set
812.75 818.30	of students so when my 62 year old
818.30 821.12	student said yes to come on board this
821.12 824.30	platform to stream that surprised me and
824.30 837.83	gave me more I have also children who
837.83 839.72	have tried already their home-based
839.72 842.66	learning so they were open to streaming
842.66 845.78	online so with the online streaming my
845.78 848.90	earnings recovered like 20 or 30 percent
848.90 852.80	more you're not back to 100% but it's
852.80 859.51	something at least okay 1 2 3
859.51 862.22	it's very uplifting to be able to

986.53 987.58	interactive
987.58 990.34	the unexpected disruption brought on by
990.34 993.19	COBIT 19 is making Benji think about
993.19 999.76	diversifying his income streams when the
999.76 1001.14	pandemic blows over
1001.14 1003.63	he plans to launch a private home dining
1003.63 1006.18	service with his business partner who is
1006.18 1008.49	an avid cook one thing I learned from
1008.49 1010.50	this coffee situation right is do not
1010.50 1012.47	put everything into one basket
1012.47 1015.75	why if there's a co v20 I'd want to have
1015.75 1017.64	no income again and we must learn to
1017.64 1023.64	adapt to it
1023.64 1026.18	[Music]
1026.18 1029.31	so this morning we have an order from
1029.31 1031.53	another of my outlet so I'm going to
1031.53 1033.30	pick out the noodles and sent to the
1033.30 1034.46	customer
1034.46 1037.11	mehgan's for restaurants cannot provide
1037.11 1039.03	dine in service during the circuit
1039.03 1041.79	breaker so she has to rely entirely on
1041.79 1044.24	deliveries and take outs to keep afloat
1044.24 1046.56	right behind me is somebody doing
1046.56 1055.68	delivery to delivering for myself it was
1055.68 1058.14	not something I envisioned myself doing
1058.14 1066.44	on my career to be but I had to do it
1066.44 1070.63	sorry sorry doing the same thing
1070.63 1077.28	[Music]
1077.28 1086.34	[Music]
1086.34 1094.72	Samantha as orders picked up it became
1094.72 1097.12	unsustainable for Megan to continue
1097.12 1099.70	doing the deliveries on her own so she
1099.70 1101.22	partnered with an e-commerce platform
1101.22 1104.44	that not only delivers island-wide but
1104.44 1106.42	also offers a better rate than the main
1106.42 1116.89	food delivery apps in Singapore so the
1116.89 1118.63	order so kami automatically on the
1118.63 1120.79	e-commerce platform drivers will be
1120.79 1122.56	allocated automatically and they will
1122.56 1124.57	come in pick this up and send it to our
1124.57 1127.78	customers so now two weeks later our
1127.78 1130.45	circuit breaker we average about 30 to
1130.45 1134.29	35 deliveries a day we are working so
1134.29 1137.33	hard now doing online fulfilled
1137.33 1140.18	it's simply just to mitigate the loss
1140.18 1141.65	they're not even thinking I'm making
1141.65 1145.67	profits two weeks shy of the circuit
1145.67 1149.21	breakers end comes more crushing news to
1149.21 1151.25	bring down daily inflection small
1151.25 1154.04	sharply we will therefore extend the
1154.04 1156.29	circuit breaker for four more weeks
1156.29 1165.65	until the first of June in general in
1165.65 1168.49	Singapore now I think I've arrived a low
1168.49 1171.73	low 30 I find it in Europe until the
1171.73 1174.80	frigid I my finger finest name I'm
1174.80 1177.23	worried more for myself also my father
1177.23 1183.86	finance me if someone is pleased I
1183.86 1189.44	figure why not my we know at 57 years
1189.44 1191.54	old Ken Singh is considered more
1191.54 1193.97	vulnerable to covert 19 than younger age
1193.97 1196.19	groups but that hasn't stopped him from
