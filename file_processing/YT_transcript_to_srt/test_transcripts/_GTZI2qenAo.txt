12.56 17.44	everything changed when kovit happened
17.44 21.52	i was on my way to work and i received
21.52 25.52	an email from my boss i've been revenge
25.52 28.96	that's it
28.96 30.72	wouldn't use the word burden but i just
30.72 32.38	didn't want to get my parents worried
32.38 34.00	[Music]
34.00 36.32	because i've covert when i'm about to
36.32 39.12	pass away what do i want to look back on
39.12 40.56	most of the teams are all family
40.56 42.96	breadwinners so it's important that they
42.96 44.24	keep the job
44.24 46.00	we did talk around with the idea that
46.00 47.44	it's totally different from what we have
47.44 49.05	been doing
49.05 52.64	[Music]
52.64 54.32	so much effort and then we are not
54.32 56.80	earning much of profiting out of it
56.80 58.88	how do we move things forward from this
58.88 84.56	and become better
84.56 88.15	my name is
88.15 98.24	[Music]
98.24 101.28	i hate going to the market i'll try to
101.28 102.08	avoid it
102.08 104.88	since young i don't really like the
104.88 105.84	smell
105.84 108.56	the hustle the slippery floors of the
108.56 109.12	market
109.12 111.28	[Music]
111.28 114.32	but things have changed now
114.32 116.96	i probably visited the market more than
116.96 118.40	i ever visited in the past
118.40 121.85	30 plus years
121.85 123.60	[Applause]
123.60 126.64	freelancers here are feeling the heat as
126.64 130.48	the covet 19 situation works
130.48 133.12	before the pandemic mom conduct a lot of
133.12 135.28	cooking classes
135.28 137.52	students will come to our house and
137.52 138.40	learn dishes
138.40 142.08	and they will pay a fee for it that is a
142.08 145.20	property agent my wife xiaomi and i
145.20 147.60	shoot wedding videos and corporate
147.60 149.86	videos for our clients
149.86 153.04	[Music]
153.04 157.92	the freelancers live isn't easy
157.92 161.12	for two years we kind of have sufficient
161.12 162.56	jobs coming in
162.56 165.28	month to month but this time during the
165.28 166.32	circuit breaker
166.32 168.56	mom can't host her regular classes that
168.56 171.68	she have been doing for years
171.68 173.44	when government announced a circuit
173.44 175.60	breaker only
175.60 178.96	essential worker can go out to work
178.96 182.08	we have to stay home it's bad for
182.08 183.68	everybody
183.68 186.72	when we didn't have any income coming in
186.72 190.00	we started to worry about how how long
190.00 191.28	can our savings
191.28 194.96	last us that is
194.96 198.40	really stressful actually course there's
198.40 198.88	the
198.88 202.48	utility bills and stuff
202.48 205.04	we have to service our mortgage for this
205.04 205.68	house
205.68 217.75	so our cpf got wiped out now
217.75 225.36	[Music]
225.36 227.20	layoffs in the second quarter of this
227.20 229.44	year more than doubled from pre-covert
229.44 230.48	19 levels
230.48 233.20	to over 8 000 even as total employment
233.20 234.40	continued to fall
234.40 238.80	by around 104 000 in the same period
238.80 240.88	we first heard about the news of the
240.88 242.00	plan shutting down
242.00 245.92	and letting go of staff around april
245.92 249.28	i was not that overly worried because i
249.28 249.60	was
249.60 252.84	in that company for seven and a half
252.84 254.40	years
254.40 262.08	but of course reality comes and hits me
262.08 265.12	my name is muhammad nasir jafar i'm 47
265.12 267.60	years old
267.60 270.40	i was a city quality engineer from an
270.40 275.76	oil and gas mnc
275.76 278.00	i still can remember very vividly when
278.00 279.68	my managers say that
279.68 282.95	jay i'm sorry we have to let you go
282.95 284.88	[Music]
284.88 289.12	i was lost for that 5-10 minutes
289.12 292.32	when you hear it itself from your boss
292.32 293.12	right
293.12 295.52	yeah that is when it hits you really
295.52 299.76	hard
299.76 302.16	for four months i submitted more than 60
302.16 303.60	applications
303.60 306.56	i tried semiconductor pharmaceutical
306.56 309.52	electronics industry as well chemicals
309.52 312.56	but still nothing
312.56 316.40	never in my life that i feel unwanted
316.40 344.35	why is it happening why is it me
344.35 348.32	[Laughter]
348.32 351.12	i'm doing the easiest part like cutting
351.12 352.64	potatoes
352.64 355.28	my mom is in charge of the curry chicken
355.28 356.72	portion
356.72 362.64	and charmaine is doing the bread portion
362.64 365.52	growing up every friends gathering
365.52 366.56	birthdays
366.56 369.04	family gathering my mom will always
369.04 369.76	prepare a
369.76 372.32	pot of delicious curry for everyone to
372.32 374.88	share it's everyone's favorite
374.88 376.80	during the circuit breakers a lot of our
376.80 379.44	peers do facebook live cooking shows
379.44 382.24	and mom kind of felt pressurized to step
382.24 383.12	up to
383.12 390.72	to do it online as well
390.72 392.40	we wonder what could interest
392.40 395.76	singaporeans her customer base
395.76 398.05	she thought of curry bands
398.05 404.56	[Music]
404.56 406.72	it was purely just to demonstrate how to
406.72 408.08	cook it
408.08 411.04	but by chance we gave some of the buns
411.04 411.92	too
411.92 414.40	to our neighbors and friends and sales
414.40 415.28	started
415.28 422.54	coming in
422.54 426.16	[Music]
426.16 429.04	it started out with just two of us mom
429.04 430.16	and i
430.16 432.96	running all over looking for ingredients
432.96 433.92	making the bands
433.92 437.42	delivering the vans ourselves
437.42 445.68	[Music]
445.68 448.88	and then as more orders came in we
448.88 451.92	couldn't handle it alone
451.92 454.85	so lester and dad stepped in to help
454.85 457.92	[Music]
457.92 460.48	at that point of time we didn't think of
460.48 461.68	it as a business
461.68 463.92	we were just happy that someone wants to
463.92 470.99	buy yeah
470.99 475.84	[Music]
475.84 477.60	in the beginning of the year kovit
477.60 479.20	happened and
479.20 480.31	everything changed
480.31 484.00	[Music]
484.00 485.60	there was this fear like oh okay i'm
485.60 487.76	unable to find a job
487.76 489.52	wouldn't use the word burden but i just
489.52 492.80	didn't want to get my parents worried
492.80 495.60	my name is chiven i'm a third year
495.60 497.84	student in smu
497.84 500.72	23rd april was when my exam ended i
500.72 502.64	thought my whole summer is ahead of me
502.64 505.20	what am i going to do
505.20 507.60	i wanted to get internship in a company
507.60 509.28	in singapore
509.28 511.52	unfortunately when kovit happened i
511.52 513.12	couldn't get an internship
513.12 515.68	yeah so that's when i started to look
515.68 520.32	for other things to spend my time
520.32 521.44	so today i'm actually going to be
521.44 523.60	filming a tip talk it's something that
523.60 526.16	i've started doing circuit breaker
526.16 528.32	so i usually connect it to my laptop
528.32 529.44	over here
529.44 531.84	and then this other setup was where i'll
531.84 532.96	put my phone
532.96 534.56	and that's where the whole creation
534.56 537.60	begins
537.60 539.68	many like me were feeling bored they
539.68 541.36	wanted an outlet to
541.36 544.80	just laugh a bit when i seen so many
544.80 546.88	singaporean families dancing together
546.88 547.68	with their kid
547.68 551.44	i think it's really cute
551.44 554.48	that's when i learned a dance a very
554.48 564.00	famous tik tok dance
564.00 566.16	when i posted it there was barely even
566.16 568.00	one or two likes
568.00 570.08	i knew it wouldn't get viral because a
570.08 571.83	lot of people do that
571.83 573.20	[Music]
573.20 576.48	i started to experiment with new ideas
576.48 578.88	and that's when i found that video that
578.88 579.52	worked
579.52 582.16	you again people like relatable content
582.16 583.92	people like funny content
583.92 586.24	so when i started to do more so of that
586.24 588.00	that's when i think
588.00 593.92	people had positive response
593.92 596.24	the video got viral and i think it's
596.24 598.56	garnered about 200 000 views in one
598.56 599.36	night
599.36 602.80	i was quite shocked at that
602.80 604.56	i think a lot of girls found it funny
604.56 606.16	and relatable because
606.16 608.88	they too had unshaped eyebrows because
608.88 609.28	of
609.28 611.20	circuit breaker your first time do
611.20 613.12	facial is it
613.12 615.52	okay yeah i see you got a bit of black
615.52 618.80	hair right here
618.80 621.68	so this one also kind of was went viral
621.68 623.60	in the temple community because it's
623.60 625.52	true right
625.52 628.32	how many people liked it about like four
628.32 630.00	thousand like four thousand
630.00 631.92	from india not from india local
631.92 633.92	singaporeans
633.92 635.92	because i was making people laugh i was
635.92 636.96	making people
636.96 640.64	smile made me want to create more
640.64 645.04	to date i have about 58 000 followers
645.04 649.12	really never expected any of this mischa
649.12 651.84	can i get back my phone don't ever let
651.84 653.60	me catch you using the phone again is
653.60 654.72	that clear
654.72 656.56	it was well received especially my
656.56 658.80	school content because people can
658.80 660.56	relate to it like oh my god yeah i
660.56 661.84	remember that
661.84 663.92	don't ever let me catch you using your
663.92 665.20	phone in the class again
665.20 667.60	is that clear yes i promise i won't use
667.60 670.72	it again
670.72 673.44	and that's a wrap so now comes the
673.44 675.60	editing
675.60 678.00	and all that so this is this takes a bit
678.00 679.92	of time
679.92 683.12	social media can be toxic at times and
683.12 684.88	i think i've experienced a fair share of
684.88 688.77	that as well
688.77 690.48	[Music]
690.48 692.96	i told him right from the start there
692.96 695.44	are definitely be haters
695.44 697.84	because he's seeing it on the lighter
697.84 700.08	side maybe some may not
700.08 703.68	you must be strong to accept it
703.68 705.44	some of the mean or nasty comments that
705.44 706.88	i've received is like you know he's not
706.88 708.64	funny
708.64 712.24	he can't sting a little
712.24 714.24	bit you know took the smiles off
714.24 716.88	people's face like literally
716.88 718.64	i just wanted to make people smile i
718.64 739.27	just want to make people happy
739.27 748.72	[Music]
748.72 750.64	my name is kelvin i'm the general
750.64 754.24	manager here since 2002
754.24 757.04	it's already close to 18 years that i've
757.04 759.84	been working here
759.84 762.32	we are right now in the printing room
762.32 763.60	where we have our
763.60 767.44	large format printers uh here
767.44 770.84	we were making mainly large springs for
770.84 777.84	clients
777.84 784.40	[Music]
784.40 786.80	2019 has been a very very good year uh
786.80 788.88	actually we expected 2020 to be even
788.88 791.76	better
791.76 794.96	but things take a sudden change when
794.96 798.16	circuit breaker was announced
798.16 800.56	the closure of workplaces will take
800.56 801.20	effect
801.20 804.32	from next tuesday we had to
804.32 805.84	shut down the whole operation for the
805.84 807.92	next two three months and we
807.92 812.84	totally had zero revenue from that point
812.84 820.64	onwards
820.64 824.00	in business theory with that kind of
824.00 824.96	results
824.96 828.32	we should be cutting off manpower
828.32 830.16	it's difficult for us to actually say
830.16 832.00	hey you know the business is no good
832.00 835.36	and we want to lay you off the team has
835.36 836.64	good for me for
836.64 839.04	some of them even before i joined the
839.04 840.72	company
840.72 843.68	some of them joined us for 10 years five
843.68 844.08	years
844.08 846.96	and so on most of them are all family
846.96 847.76	breadwinners
847.76 852.72	so it's important that they keep the job
852.72 855.52	while preparing for the shutdown we also
855.52 856.72	had difficulty to
856.72 859.52	purchase masks and we did toy around
859.52 861.12	with the idea that we may be
861.12 862.40	bringing in the mass production
862.40 864.16	capability into our place
864.16 867.92	to support singapore's needs for mass
867.92 869.44	it's totally different from what we have
869.44 871.14	been doing
871.14 877.92	[Music]
877.92 880.48	this is our first machine that we
880.48 881.92	imported in
881.92 885.04	we actually went to china to procure
885.04 888.40	the machines and all the supplies
888.40 890.88	we did all the installation and training
890.88 891.44	through
891.44 894.80	video conferencing and messaging
894.80 897.84	we could do about 100 000 masks a day if
897.84 900.08	we run 24 hours
900.08 901.84	this will become a challenge because our
901.84 903.20	team actually needs
903.20 904.59	a different set of skills
904.59 910.72	[Music]
910.72 913.52	previously my role was a fine art print
913.52 914.24	maker
914.24 917.12	it switched overnight and now i'm doing
917.12 918.40	face masks
918.40 920.64	doing the quality control and also to
920.64 922.80	check packing
922.80 925.68	so totally no experience brand new
925.68 928.05	uncharted waters
928.05 929.36	[Music]
929.36 932.08	hi chung how is the adjustment to the
932.08 934.56	machine after we decided that
934.56 937.20	the earlobes and all the things are not
937.20 938.40	attached properly
938.40 943.36	are you looking into it
943.36 945.84	when we brought in these machines they
945.84 946.48	cost us
946.48 949.60	a couple hundred thousand dollars we
949.60 952.16	throw in almost uh close to one million
952.16 952.80	dollars
952.80 956.08	of cash along the way we failed at
956.08 959.28	a certain part the year loop attachment
959.28 961.84	the distance between the tick and the
961.84 962.56	joint
962.56 964.72	uh when we actually browse them together
964.72 966.64	is quite challenging because
966.64 968.88	just a little difference after movement
968.88 970.16	will actually affect the whole
970.16 974.08	attachment we need to resolve this
974.08 976.88	since of urgency those who place the
976.88 978.16	pre-orders are all
978.16 979.84	calling ourselves to make sure that they
979.84 982.64	get their deliveries done everyone knows
982.64 984.40	that they have to deliver it's just like
984.40 984.96	a war
984.96 987.60	time where everybody puts themselves
987.60 994.84	into the front line to help fight the
994.84 1004.05	war
1004.05 1009.52	[Music]
1009.52 1011.92	during kobe i had the time to like slow
1011.92 1013.60	down and think about
1013.60 1015.44	the end of the road when i'm about to
1015.44 1024.88	pass away what do i want to look back on
1024.88 1027.04	i think what's meaningful in life is
1027.04 1028.40	being able to
1028.40 1031.44	give back to the society that has given
1031.44 1039.60	you a lot
1039.60 1041.36	of course like you know i'm just one
1041.36 1053.78	person i cannot do it alone
1053.78 1060.80	[Music]
1060.80 1064.16	before covet i was living and working in
1064.16 1066.08	new york
1066.08 1069.44	around march the cases suddenly exposed
1069.44 1071.36	to the thousands
1071.36 1075.04	the city went into lockdown
1075.04 1076.88	my parents were very anxious and very
1076.88 1078.56	worried
1078.56 1080.32	and that's when i decided to return to
1080.32 1082.32	singapore
1082.32 1085.36	i actually got quite a bad sore throat
1085.36 1087.20	but i didn't have any fever so i still
1087.20 1089.52	took the flight home
1089.52 1091.36	because i was doing my parents i'm very
1091.36 1093.60	worried that i'll pass it to them
1093.60 1097.36	then i actually took myself to the
1097.36 1101.04	gp clinic to get a referral to go to a
1101.04 1104.40	e for the covet test and it was positive
1104.40 1107.28	[Music]
1107.28 1109.04	she told me about how the other
1109.04 1110.96	elderlies that were in other words were
1110.96 1111.68	suffering
1111.68 1115.76	and she was really worried for them yeah
1115.76 1119.04	singapore is an aging population
1119.04 1121.12	we see more elderly who are living alone
1121.12 1122.32	who are isolated
1122.32 1125.12	within the community they could be
1125.12 1127.20	astray from their children
1127.20 1129.84	their spouses has passed on as well or
1129.84 1131.52	their siblings are also
1131.52 1137.12	generally very elderly as well
1137.12 1140.08	i think as humans we crave for social
1140.08 1140.96	support
1140.96 1143.15	and a sense of belonging
1143.15 1152.10	[Music]
1152.10 1158.88	[Music]
1158.88 1160.48	which i recently started after
1160.48 1162.84	recovering from kobe 19 with two other
1162.84 1164.32	friends
1164.32 1166.08	the idea of kapong takis and getting
1166.08 1168.40	more volunteers in the community to help
1168.40 1169.84	their own neighbours
1169.84 1171.44	that's what keeps me going i'm trying to
1171.44 1175.12	reach more and more people
1175.12 1177.44	kampunkakis is a platform that matches
1177.44 1178.32	volunteers
1178.32 1184.98	to a neighboring need
1184.98 1190.84	[Music]
1190.84 1193.92	today
1193.92 1196.40	we try to match kakis within a 20
1196.40 1197.60	minutes walking
1197.60 1199.84	distance we want to make sure that they
1199.84 1201.68	are neighbors who can check in on each
1201.68 1209.23	other regularly
1209.23 1210.64	[Music]
1210.64 1213.84	we are a non-profit organization
1213.84 1216.24	we recruit our volunteers through social
1216.24 1218.32	media giving out flyers in the
1218.32 1219.44	neighborhood
1219.44 1221.20	right now we have close to about a
1221.20 1222.88	thousand volunteers
1222.88 1225.20	of course it hasn't been growing as
1225.20 1226.16	quickly as
1226.16 1228.24	when we first started anymore since you
1228.24 1229.76	know most people are starting to go back
1229.76 1232.96	to work
1232.96 1235.12	some of our neighbor khakis they have to
1235.12 1237.52	support more than one neighbor
1237.52 1240.00	and certain areas we don't really have
1240.00 1244.00	enough neighbor volunteers as well
1244.00 1247.12	if this initiative is stopped
1247.12 1248.96	four elderlies will really fall through
1248.96 1264.28	the gaps
1264.28 1269.76	[Music]
1269.76 1271.92	because of the pandemic for the very
1271.92 1274.08	first time i'm jobless
1274.08 1276.16	you were looking for a job via online
1276.16 1277.76	job portals
1277.76 1280.48	right no response from the applications
1280.48 1281.12	that i
1281.12 1285.68	submitted it was really zero
1285.68 1288.64	i was more than eager to actually start
1288.64 1290.00	work because it was already about
1290.00 1291.68	four months that i've been staying at
1291.68 1294.32	home right my original resume
1294.32 1296.96	was about six pages long yes yes i
1296.96 1299.04	remember it was quite a long resume
1299.04 1301.68	the first thing is to work on improving
1301.68 1302.72	his resume
1302.72 1305.84	to better highlight his technical skills
1305.84 1308.72	and knowledge
1308.72 1313.28	so after jay has worked on his resume
1313.28 1314.88	my colleague actually shared his profile
1314.88 1317.52	with 3d metal forge
1317.52 1320.24	and he was invited for interview and
1320.24 1321.76	within three days right
1321.76 1323.78	yeah he received a job offer
1323.78 1330.48	[Music]
1330.48 1333.44	3d printing is exactly the opposite of
1333.44 1335.36	what i did previously which is a
1335.36 1336.40	conventional
1336.40 1341.68	machining process
1341.68 1344.72	so it's more to my own personal worry
1344.72 1347.68	on whether i will be able to keep up
1347.68 1349.28	with the expectations
1349.28 1350.64	from my colleagues and also from the
1350.64 1352.56	company
1352.56 1355.04	i am in charge of the inspection of the
1355.04 1357.36	products to ensure that it complies to
1357.36 1359.76	the engineering drawing which specifies
1359.76 1364.48	all the requirements of the products
1364.48 1366.48	this tolerance is basically referring to
1366.48 1368.16	a surface
1368.16 1371.44	finish tolerance yes there is a surface
1371.44 1372.08	phase yeah
1372.08 1375.12	i think that was the mistake that i did
1375.12 1377.52	which resulted in some delay in the
1377.52 1379.44	world
1379.44 1380.40	engineering drawings can be very
1380.40 1383.04	complicated so jay might not have seen
1383.04 1388.08	or exposed to all these new symbols
1388.08 1390.32	if let's say we ship this out to the
1390.32 1391.36	customer
1391.36 1393.60	eventually they might not be able to use
1393.60 1395.44	these parts because it might not fit
1395.44 1398.08	into whatever they need to actually
1398.08 1400.48	assemble this component to
1400.48 1404.08	i do feel very bad actually because
1404.08 1406.16	it is an unacceptable mistake for a
1406.16 1407.68	quality engineer to
1407.68 1413.36	do to commit
1413.36 1415.60	i'm still under probation for treatment
1415.60 1417.36	of forge
1417.36 1419.84	i do not know whether i have done enough
1419.84 1421.60	up to the expectations of the company
1421.60 1431.32	for me to be confirmed
1431.32 1439.20	[Applause]
1439.20 1443.04	this is this is concerns we are smu
1443.04 1449.28	students
1449.28 1451.44	i actually wanted to get an internship
1451.44 1452.56	in a company
1452.56 1455.84	related to marketing unfortunately
1455.84 1457.68	when kovit happened i couldn't get an
1457.68 1459.92	internship
1459.92 1467.68	that's when i stumbled on tick-tock
1467.68 1470.16	types of students in morning assembly
1470.16 1470.80	son
1470.80 1472.56	four years in school helped me time my
1472.56 1474.72	time actually i've seen some people
1474.72 1477.04	posting his stories on their story and
1477.04 1478.48	those are people that don't know him and
1478.48 1479.76	that's how i knew
1479.76 1482.96	how big given switch has become
1482.96 1485.52	[Music]
1485.52 1487.60	mechanical pencil you every time kid
1487.60 1488.56	asks me
1488.56 1490.00	it's just that the week maybe surprised
1490.00 1491.92	me because i didn't expect him to have
1491.92 1492.56	that
1492.56 1495.68	a week
1495.68 1497.28	ever since i started tiptoe and gaining
1497.28 1499.04	more traction it's when like brands will
1499.04 1500.88	reach out to me
1500.88 1502.88	i still am using social media for the
1502.88 1504.56	purpose of connecting
1504.56 1506.08	talking to my friends seeing what's
1506.08 1507.76	happening in their life
1507.76 1509.68	the small change would be that now i'm
1509.68 1511.36	using social media and this
1511.36 1514.32	influence to share about a brand to my
1514.32 1516.24	friends
1516.24 1518.56	could it be maybe that i have a sizeable
1518.56 1519.52	following
1519.52 1521.52	then they see that maybe i cater a bit
1521.52 1523.68	more to the younger demographic so
1523.68 1536.08	they reached out
1536.08 1538.72	the clients are okay with the setting of
1538.72 1539.52	the scene
1539.52 1542.00	but they want me to drop the female
1542.00 1543.12	corrector
1543.12 1544.56	because they don't encourage
1544.56 1547.20	cross-dressing yeah
1547.20 1550.24	your first time do facial is that i do
1550.24 1553.20	tend to take on the persona of a girl
1553.20 1554.24	and i'll wear a wig
1554.24 1556.48	you gotta take it now working your
1556.48 1557.76	brains has been
1557.76 1562.24	bittersweet can be challenging
1562.24 1563.76	sometimes when a brain tells you okay do
1563.76 1565.68	this and then you're like
1565.68 1567.52	oh how can i make it funny you know how
1567.52 1569.52	can i make it funny
1569.52 1576.24	it's definitely not easy
1576.24 1578.80	tik tok life is a new feature it was
1578.80 1580.40	launched in the singapore market two
1580.40 1581.52	months ago
1581.52 1584.40	okay i think it's good i actually can be
1584.40 1585.20	quite nervous
1585.20 1588.40	before i go live so people who are
1588.40 1588.96	currently
1588.96 1592.88	on the app scrolling on tiktok they can
1592.88 1595.92	actually watch your live broadcast so
1595.92 1597.68	there are 13
1597.68 1600.80	13 000 people active right now
1600.80 1604.64	so i'm gonna go live let's do it
1604.64 1607.92	in three in two and one
1607.92 1612.08	yay hi guys hello hello
1612.08 1615.68	hi everyone watching uh steven
1615.68 1618.16	tiktok live helps me to interact those
1618.16 1618.88	people
1618.88 1622.08	who follow my content now more people
1622.08 1623.68	are more than ever looking at their
1623.68 1626.16	phones so i think that's where
1626.16 1629.60	you capture their attention
1629.60 1632.64	so someone sent one diamond so these can
1632.64 1634.16	be translated into
1634.16 1636.48	cash there's also this cool feature
1636.48 1638.08	where people who have actually
1638.08 1639.60	been following you for some time right
1639.60 1641.20	they can actually reward you
1641.20 1644.32	with certain coins i would say one coin
1644.32 1646.88	maybe is two cents sometimes they may
1646.88 1648.24	give you five coins
1648.24 1650.38	so that is uh that's like 10 cents
1650.38 1651.76	[Music]
1651.76 1654.00	i was glad that there was still job
1654.00 1654.96	opportunities
1654.96 1657.84	in the midst of kovit i've been
1657.84 1659.20	receiving some offers
1659.20 1661.52	from brands to collab and to promote
1661.52 1663.92	their merchandise or their brand
1663.92 1666.40	so most of them would really be less
1666.40 1667.76	than 500
1667.76 1670.96	so i would say on average i do like four
1670.96 1673.68	for a month i still have two more years
1673.68 1675.68	before i graduate
1675.68 1677.92	that money will go into helping me pay
1677.92 1682.82	off my school fees
1682.82 1694.84	[Applause]
1694.84 1698.88	so
1698.88 1700.72	it's hard to motivate yourself to wake
1700.72 1702.40	up early in the morning when the sky is
1702.40 1703.76	still dark
1703.76 1705.84	but to deliver the orders we have to
1705.84 1708.00	wake up like at 5 00 am
1708.00 1711.92	4 30 am sometimes our brand name is
1711.92 1715.04	in my curry bun in short
1715.04 1718.32	it's it my cb which is a reference to
1718.32 1721.60	circuit breaker there's of course people
1721.60 1722.24	who
1722.24 1725.68	really dislike the name but as a
1725.68 1728.24	home-based business starting in circuit
1728.24 1729.28	breaker
1729.28 1732.24	we have to take certain creative risks
1732.24 1735.20	we sell our curry runs on instagram
1735.20 1737.12	our customers direct message us and
1737.12 1738.72	we'll follow up with their orders
1738.72 1742.24	through there we started
1742.24 1744.48	this business with no business plan
1744.48 1746.56	we're just selling one kariban at a time
1746.56 1748.88	to survive this pandemic none of us
1748.88 1749.84	studied business
1749.84 1754.24	none of us studied culinary
1754.24 1756.16	customers all around singapore wanted to
1756.16 1757.76	try our curry bun
1757.76 1760.40	so we deliver island white with zero
1760.40 1767.66	delivery costs
1767.66 1769.84	[Music]
1769.84 1771.36	and then the end of the day we realized
1771.36 1776.64	that we are making such a loss
1776.64 1779.60	i remember feeling very disappointed
1779.60 1780.00	after
1780.00 1782.72	all this hustle all these efforts
1782.72 1784.24	ultimately could not support
1784.24 1787.68	us so i thought
1787.68 1789.76	how do we move things forward from this
1789.76 1792.32	and become better
1792.32 1806.96	saturday yeah
1806.96 1809.84	the delivery route so my dad will just
1809.84 1811.44	follow accordingly to
1811.44 1813.20	the house number one number two number
1813.20 1816.96	three etc
1816.96 1820.88	i am designing the packaging
1820.88 1823.76	i put on a little doodle something
1823.76 1826.76	personalized for our customers
1826.76 1828.40	[Music]
1828.40 1831.04	mom did a lot of groundwork for refining
1831.04 1833.28	the recipes
1833.28 1835.36	my brother is very good with numbers and
1835.36 1836.48	help us to
1836.48 1839.20	calculate all the ingredients cost
1839.20 1841.52	packaging cost
1841.52 1846.12	that helps us with all the delivery
1846.12 1848.64	[Music]
1848.64 1851.92	we have to also pick up some side
1851.92 1854.56	hustles
1854.56 1857.52	so i'm editing a wedding video right now
1857.52 1858.96	we had to juggle between
1858.96 1861.92	both the caribou business and the video
1861.92 1862.64	business
1862.64 1865.20	which is a challenge because xiamen is
1865.20 1866.72	very much involved in the
1866.72 1870.64	kitchen process if we stop
1870.64 1872.48	doing the curry buns then what will
1872.48 1876.08	happen to our parents
1876.08 1878.32	mom and dad have been freelancers all
1878.32 1879.84	their lives and
1879.84 1882.32	they are not of age to redraw from their
1882.32 1883.44	cpf anyway
1883.44 1886.88	so they really needed to rely on
1886.88 1889.92	their job to provide for themselves
1889.92 1891.84	so with the khariban business they are
1891.84 1894.48	able to get an income
1894.48 1897.96	at least
1897.96 1904.24	[Music]
1904.24 1908.64	this is your cat i'll rescue them
1908.64 1911.57	so you feed them every day
1911.57 1913.28	[Music]
1913.28 1915.04	i was actually inspired by my own
1915.04 1916.40	parents
1916.40 1919.76	my parents would prepare food to help
1919.76 1922.80	my stay alone senior neighbour so
1922.80 1924.48	that kind of you know sharing and giving
1924.48 1926.00	spirit is something that
1926.00 1927.60	really inspired me to start kampung

1943.76 1947.68	beneficiary salkakis in need
1947.68 1949.52	one of the things we realized is that
1949.52 1951.52	actually a lot of the elderly
1951.52 1953.84	were not very tech savvy and therefore
1953.84 1956.40	they felt more isolated
1956.40 1958.64	so my team decided to start a new
1958.64 1960.88	initiative called digital car keys
1960.88 1962.80	where we use our network of kaki
1962.80 1963.92	volunteers
1963.92 1972.40	to become sort of the tech support

2002.84 2007.04	bye
2007.04 2009.68	if kobe didn't happen i probably would
2009.68 2011.52	still be quite busy with my
2011.52 2015.20	daily life and work and maybe didn't put
2015.20 2016.72	so much thought into
2016.72 2021.52	how we can do more to help the community
2021.52 2023.92	i had the chance to really slow down and
2023.92 2025.68	reflect upon my life and how i was
2025.68 2027.12	leaving it
2027.12 2029.12	if i was to continue in new york i
2029.12 2032.40	wouldn't be able to do all that
2032.40 2034.88	after i came back to singapore i still
2034.88 2036.16	had my job in the u.s
2036.16 2039.04	so i would work late hours from eight pm
2039.04 2039.84	to about
2039.84 2042.56	seven am the next day it was quite
2042.56 2043.60	difficult because
2043.60 2045.76	i would start working on khakis in the
2045.76 2047.12	afternoon before i
2047.12 2048.40	you know commenced my work in the
2048.40 2055.92	evening
2055.92 2058.84	i actually did go back to the us from
2058.84 2060.96	july it was very hard
2060.96 2063.52	trying to manage kaponkakis from the u.s
2063.52 2066.40	because of time zone differences
2066.40 2068.96	i wanted to come back and see it you
2068.96 2070.16	know continue
2070.16 2074.33	to grow
2074.33 2078.51	[Music]
2078.51 2083.52	[Applause]
2083.52 2093.44	[Music]
2093.44 2096.80	we have 25 to 30 employees
2096.80 2101.36	most of them are all family breadwinners
2101.36 2103.76	during the pandemic our printing pieces
2103.76 2105.76	were all shut
2105.76 2109.76	we should be cutting off manpower
2109.76 2112.08	but we chose the face mask manufacturing
2112.08 2113.04	to actually help
2113.04 2117.20	to save the jobs even up to today we
2117.20 2118.40	still have a full team
2118.40 2119.14	with us
2119.14 2121.84	[Music]
2121.84 2127.28	okay
2127.28 2129.52	we had some issues on the yellow
2129.52 2131.60	customers are complaining so we took the
2131.60 2132.64	feedbacks
2132.64 2135.76	we put in more stringent checks
2135.76 2138.24	it took us some time before we will come
2138.24 2139.76	and get a better product out there to
2139.76 2142.08	the market
2142.08 2144.80	the pandemic actually forces us to think
2144.80 2146.40	out of the box
2146.40 2148.88	to really move ourselves from our
2148.88 2149.84	comfort zone
2149.84 2151.84	to actually protect everyone's
2151.84 2153.04	likelihood
2153.04 2155.36	to evolve the business to change it to
2155.36 2156.96	bring ourselves online
2156.96 2159.76	and to expand to different portfolios to
2159.76 2161.52	make sure that we are still relevant
2161.52 2166.16	during the difficult times
2166.16 2167.76	we thought that it was a good mix to
2167.76 2169.36	actually expand the whole product line
2169.36 2169.76	with
2169.76 2172.89	hand sanitizer
2172.89 2178.16	[Music]
2178.16 2180.96	june is where we started back our
2180.96 2182.08	printing production
2182.08 2188.40	after the three months stopped
2188.40 2190.88	right now i'm back to doing my previous
2190.88 2191.92	role as a
2191.92 2193.92	fine art print maker i oversee the
2193.92 2195.76	printing from the
2195.76 2199.12	color editing to the quality control
2199.12 2202.00	so back to normal i would say happy to
2202.00 2203.60	be doing something that i'm familiar
2203.60 2204.48	with
2204.48 2207.91	okay so this is safe
2207.91 2209.68	[Music]
2209.68 2212.24	now everybody is trying to do promotions
2212.24 2214.16	so the activities are rolling back in
2214.16 2215.36	quickly
2215.36 2217.12	but the production of the face mask
2217.12 2218.27	still continues
2218.27 2221.52	[Music]
2221.52 2225.04	we believe that holding this capability
2225.04 2227.60	for future safety net is actually
2227.60 2228.48	important
2228.48 2230.88	so we decided to keep the the mass
2230.88 2232.08	manufacturing
2232.08 2236.01	business uh alive um as long as we can
2236.01 2238.24	[Music]
2238.24 2242.00	machine level
2242.00 2244.32	pandemic has actually brought us
2244.32 2246.24	stronger together
2246.24 2248.48	we have learned to think in all the
2248.48 2250.48	different perspectives
2250.48 2252.00	don't just keep looking at what they are
2252.00 2254.00	doing right now and
2254.00 2255.68	you should be able to find the other
2255.68 2272.48	part of goal
2272.48 2275.52	what else you have to do preparation for
2275.52 2276.16	tomorrow
2276.16 2279.76	okay we tried juggling
2279.76 2282.84	our videography business and the caribon
2282.84 2285.68	business but that also means that
2285.68 2289.28	we don't have any rest day at all
2289.28 2292.64	it's difficult and it's really draining
2292.64 2293.84	sometimes
2293.84 2298.63	but i think it's worth it
2298.63 2306.88	[Music]
2306.88 2309.60	honestly if we were to stop this curry
2309.60 2311.36	bun tomorrow
2311.36 2314.88	we would just go out and work harder
2314.88 2318.00	in our respective jobs but what's
2318.00 2319.28	keeping us together now
2319.28 2322.32	it's the chance to work together as a
2322.32 2323.36	family
2323.36 2328.08	and to earn together as a family
2328.08 2330.64	sometimes we also wonder whether the
2330.64 2332.40	very generous support we get from our
2332.40 2334.32	customers and friends
2334.32 2337.92	is this one is this thing gonna last and
2337.92 2339.60	is there future in the caribbean
2339.60 2343.60	business we don't really know as well
2343.60 2346.08	do you want to continue doing it if we
2346.08 2346.96	can if
2346.96 2349.76	people still want to eat our curry buns

2584.96 2586.32	to make a change
2586.32 2588.00	but when you hang around people who are
2588.00 2590.24	all change makers i think you
2590.24 2592.96	are more hopeful that yeah we can make a
2592.96 2593.68	difference
2593.68 2595.36	in singapore together

2596.72 2599.28	this pandemic has taught me to be okay
2599.28 2600.32	with change
2600.32 2603.28	we just have to adapt and work even
2603.28 2605.20	harder when we are out of our comfort
2605.20 2607.52	zone because life is
2607.52 2609.75	always going to be unpredictable
2609.75 2615.36	[Music]
2615.36 2618.08	i'm day dreaming about traveling shamin

2620.96 2633.85	buns around the world
2633.85 2648.01	[Music]
