139.82 147.98	I am people think we are dealing with
147.98 149.99	hardened criminals because of what they
149.99 152.93	see in popular fiction
152.93 156.20	[Music]
156.20 159.76	and he'll 42c
159.76 163.97	so should I move your friends over this
163.97 165.89	job is more than just studying really a
165.89 169.55	lot of pitches while you empathize more
169.55 171.41	and the guys because it pretty them I
171.41 172.88	think is more because you want to
172.88 174.65	understand what they are being true so
174.65 177.65	they can have them to be better
177.65 185.80	[Music]
185.80 188.59	although we move towards the concert
188.59 192.55	we have people patrolling around
192.55 195.49	to make sure by something therefore
195.49 196.42	during the visit
196.42 198.72	we'll be there to comfort them
198.72 211.37	[Music]
211.37 214.11	the other one says he may was informed
214.11 215.91	that the brother pastor would sleep the
215.91 217.79	night before and she is actually very
217.79 220.68	close with her brother so when she came
220.68 221.88	out from the community room she was
221.88 224.79	reserved for without water to clean so
224.79 226.38	she ran back toward Southwest and then
226.38 228.09	subsequently during Swedish we spoke to
228.09 230.16	her gate and she was perceptive on the
230.16 237.00	news early
237.00 238.62	you
238.62 256.51	[Music]
256.51 273.83	someone say something because it happens
273.83 274.25	all the time
274.25 282.28	so go be somewhere maybe he's curious
282.28 284.90	maybe different story motifs on
284.90 290.66	pathology Cosima Hadees Familia tempered
290.66 294.49	person Shana but as time goes by that my
294.49 296.90	contribution here I managed to mellow
296.90 300.23	down and really change a lot of my
300.23 304.01	thoughts and behaviors to overcome these
304.01 307.54	problems that I will face in the future
307.54 311.12	[Music]
311.12 313.17	so that'sthat's the challenges that
313.17 314.64	these women have because they're always
314.64 316.02	wondering what's happening to the
316.02 317.97	children are they doing well we need to
317.97 320.01	dare target the program to see how best
320.01 338.01	to talk about the emotions
338.01 341.62	in a housing room we can do so much we
341.62 343.15	would see them three times a week the
343.15 345.94	officers see them every day so whatever
345.94 348.25	we teach but the skills in the group
348.25 350.95	sessions the officers would then need to
350.95 361.81	actually reinforce why it's your least
361.81 370.08	favorite thing to eat sardine anything
370.08 378.06	what do they request now hating for me
378.06 398.28	[Music]
398.28 401.53	doing actual work instead of just
401.53 402.94	programs that equip them with basic
402.94 405.54	skills give them an opportunity to
405.54 407.25	have a sense of contributing back to
407.25 408.81	society
408.81 415.88	[Music]
415.88 417.43	[Music]
417.43 429.36	you
429.36 436.29	you
436.29 441.30	well do me what the watch you can learn
441.30 443.26	also on the video I also want to watch
443.26 447.49	ah I see you like one angle so sometimes
447.49 449.38	instead of going out to the yard so
449.38 451.75	actually stay in the day would they get
451.75 453.19	to do activities night leading
453.19 455.38	newspapers watching television
455.38 456.73	that way their baby
456.73 465.61	I think in general inmates do prefer
465.61 467.59	watching variety shows such as America's
467.59 470.38	foreteller and things that have revealed
470.38 472.30	to go sector it actually helps them to
472.30 481.72	seal and I guess a why we have got that
481.72 483.16	is everything because I feel like if we
483.16 484.69	make them a better person they go out to
484.69 486.01	be a better person we would have one
486.01 489.37	less prisoner I think it's also very
489.37 491.89	easy to judge like when you meet the
491.89 496.00	papers and you read about crimes that in
496.00 499.33	your opinion horrific I think the
499.33 502.45	important thing to remember is that one
502.45 505.72	inmate doesn't speak for everyone it
505.72 507.97	would be fair to give everyone a second
507.97 514.55	chance to prove themselves
514.55 517.94	[Music]
517.94 520.00	you
