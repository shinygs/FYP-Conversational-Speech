11.78 17.84	[Music]
17.84 19.28	so it feels great being out here in the
19.28 19.68	open
19.68 22.56	but studies show that in reality we
22.56 23.60	spend 90
23.60 31.92	of our time indoors
31.92 34.08	now with various studies pointing to
34.08 37.52	covet 19 being potentially airborne
37.52 39.68	is it time we pay more attention to the
39.68 45.52	air we are breathing at home
45.52 47.60	i bought myself an air purifier about
47.60 49.28	five years ago when singapore was
49.28 51.52	dealing with the regional haze crisis
51.52 53.84	but you know what i haven't been using
53.84 56.48	it it's been sitting here
56.48 60.48	in my storeroom oh i think for the past
60.48 62.72	three years so in this episode of
62.72 63.60	talking point
63.60 65.52	i want to find out if we really need air
65.52 67.28	purifiers in our home and
67.28 74.80	just how effective are these things
74.80 77.04	sales for air purifiers surged when
77.04 79.04	singapore was hit by the regional haze
79.04 80.72	in 2018
80.72 82.96	and when the corvette 19 pandemic struck
82.96 84.56	early this year
84.56 87.60	demand spiked again retailers say
87.60 91.04	sales went up by up to five times
91.04 93.60	compared with the same period last year
93.60 95.12	do you have any air purifiers at all
95.12 97.28	yeah i do i do have a fire at home i
97.28 98.80	ran the home studio so it's very
98.80 100.16	important to keep the air clean at home
100.16 101.92	what made you get them worry about dust
101.92 102.72	and allergies
102.72 104.72	and do you find that it's been effective
104.72 106.24	when you breathe you actually feel that
106.24 107.12	the air is thinner
107.12 109.12	especially the smell you put it there
109.12 110.16	the smell will go on
110.16 112.00	there's less dust and what i understand
112.00 114.00	the filter can trap bacteria
114.00 117.36	and viruses
117.36 119.28	there's growing evidence that suggests
119.28 120.64	corvette 19 is
120.64 123.36	airborne this means that if i am in a
123.36 125.52	poorly ventilated enclosed space
125.52 128.24	with an infected person i might contract
128.24 129.92	the virus too
129.92 132.08	of course we're looking at an extended
132.08 136.56	exposure of about 30 minutes
136.56 139.20	but still it's better to be safe than
139.20 140.56	sorry
140.56 143.04	i want to know if air purifiers can rid
143.04 144.80	the air of the coronavirus
144.80 146.88	so i'm going to the one place that will
146.88 149.92	have all the answers about colvit 19.
149.92 151.60	singapore's national center for
151.60 157.44	infectious diseases
157.44 159.76	dr glory joy tan specializes in
159.76 162.16	controlling and preventing infection
162.16 164.40	and was involved in developing a test to
164.40 166.16	check symptoms for corvette 19
166.16 169.44	infections
169.44 172.08	so is the air purifier able to catch
172.08 174.00	those particles from the coronavirus
174.00 175.68	based on our current understanding
175.68 177.68	uh the main modality of transmission of
177.68 179.92	covat19 remains primarily through
179.92 182.00	respiratory droplets as well as contact
182.00 182.88	transmission
182.88 184.08	however there may be certain
184.08 186.16	circumstances in which airborne
186.16 188.40	transmission of covet-19 could occur
188.40 191.60	and this may be in a setting where there
191.60 193.04	are a lot of people within a very
193.04 194.00	enclosed space
194.00 196.56	doing very specific activities such as
196.56 201.52	speaking in very loud voices or singing
201.52 202.80	most of the air filters that we are
202.80 204.00	talking about these days pride
204.00 205.84	themselves on having an hipaa filter
205.84 207.44	and the hipaa filter holds itself to a
207.44 208.96	very high standard in that it's
208.96 210.84	specified to filter out up to i think
210.84 212.08	99.97
212.08 214.48	of particles this includes infective
214.48 216.32	pathogens and viruses
216.32 219.28	and so i guess an air purifier with a
219.28 220.32	hepa filter
220.32 222.40	would probably be quite effective
222.40 223.60	especially if the
223.60 225.84	air sort of circulates through the air
225.84 227.44	purifier multiple times
227.44 228.96	however having said that i think we
228.96 230.96	should be mindful not to think of the
230.96 233.04	air purifier as like a magic bullet
233.04 235.76	i think the overall strategy to reduce
235.76 237.84	one's risk really would be to include
237.84 238.40	things like
238.40 243.28	frequent hand washing wiping of surfaces
243.28 245.60	air purifier itself while it may provide
245.60 246.56	an adjunct
246.56 248.88	to improving the air quality shouldn't
248.88 250.16	be thought of as like
250.16 252.80	the magic bullet to keeping ourselves
252.80 253.36	safe
253.36 259.76	from infective pathogens in general
259.76 262.24	basic air purifiers come with what's
262.24 263.76	called hepa filters
263.76 266.88	and activated carbon hepa filters are a
266.88 268.64	grader filter that can remove
268.64 272.00	microscopic particles in the air
272.00 274.56	together with the activated carbon these
274.56 275.68	air purifiers
275.68 278.00	claim to remove harmful substances from
278.00 287.12	the air by up to 99.9 percent
287.12 289.52	an air purifier with a heaper filter may
289.52 291.68	protect us from covert 19 in the air
291.68 296.72	but as i've learned it's no magic bullet
296.72 298.88	covet 19 isn't the only thing that's
298.88 300.48	lurking in our air
300.48 302.48	many studies have reported that the air
302.48 303.68	inside our homes
303.68 306.88	is far dirtier than the air outside
306.88 311.04	shocking isn't it
311.04 313.28	professor tom cox why has been studying
313.28 314.56	indoor air quality
314.56 317.52	for more than 30 years and he's going to
317.52 318.32	tell me
318.32 321.84	what's in every breath i take
321.84 323.44	so professor tell me what would be some
323.44 325.36	of the most common contaminants we find
325.36 326.88	in the air i think we broadly can
326.88 329.12	classify as three different categories
329.12 330.88	the first is what we call the physical
330.88 332.64	contaminants so these are
332.64 335.36	principally dust the second category i
335.36 337.44	think that much more pervasive
337.44 339.52	it is gaseous it flows all around the
339.52 341.52	place and we basically briefed it in
341.52 342.72	and the third are things which are
342.72 344.72	basically living organisms what we call
344.72 345.92	the biological
345.92 348.88	category and from these three categories
348.88 349.84	where did they come from
349.84 351.84	uh let's take das for example the
351.84 353.84	physical ones i'm sure that this is a
353.84 355.12	very common household
355.12 356.80	vacuum cleaner yeah one of the things
356.80 358.72	that we must understand is that when it
358.72 360.40	sucks in the dust you can see the filter
360.40 361.44	inside over here
361.44 363.52	the filter does not remove everything
363.52 365.52	and this means sucking must come out
365.52 367.20	and unfortunately the finer does
367.20 369.44	basically follow the airstream out
369.44 371.76	the final ones actually become airborne
371.76 373.44	and this final one's actually much more
373.44 375.04	damaging because they're small
375.04 376.80	they remain airborne and they actually
376.80 378.72	go much deeper in their lungs
378.72 380.48	the other part that i'm going to mention
380.48 381.92	may scare you a little bit okay
381.92 383.52	when it is actually being sucked through
383.52 385.28	this it actually churns
385.28 387.36	that grinding so the bigger particles
387.36 389.20	become smaller particles
389.20 394.08	imagine your cockroach egg
394.08 395.68	and the very thing that you actually
395.68 397.76	don't want this can ground and then
397.76 398.56	maybe
398.56 400.32	become very small particles they get
400.32 402.40	born
402.40 405.04	so when we vacuum our homes we remove
405.04 407.12	the dust that is visible to the eye
407.12 409.04	but inadvertently release finer
409.04 411.28	pollutants which are invisible
411.28 414.56	back into the air to avoid this
414.56 416.72	proftam recommends using a vacuum
416.72 418.72	cleaner with a water filter
418.72 420.96	the water will prevent finer pollutants
420.96 423.76	from being released back into the air
423.76 425.60	what else contributes to pollutants in
425.60 427.68	the air gaseous pollutants are one of
427.68 428.56	the most
428.56 430.24	important exposures that we must guard
430.24 432.40	against thick cooking for example
432.40 434.40	firstly there are two types of cooking
434.40 436.80	one uses gas or town gas which is still
436.80 438.16	quite common but you think
438.16 439.92	the source of the heat is really because
439.92 441.68	of the combustion of the town gas
441.68 443.60	okay and that combustion will produce
443.60 445.92	by-products and we are inhaling them
445.92 447.84	not all of which are actually good for
447.84 449.84	the body are there any other areas that
449.84 451.12	would be of concern in our home
451.12 452.96	i think there's one one last category
452.96 454.08	that i mentioned which is the
454.08 456.08	biologicals there are things which are
456.08 458.96	very minor in nature the bacteria in
458.96 460.00	particular most
460.00 462.80	so if you smell something musky is
462.80 464.88	actually an indication that it is mold
464.88 465.60	infested
465.60 467.52	and some of this mold they produce
467.52 468.80	chemicals which are toxic
468.80 471.84	to the body so it seems that the air in
471.84 472.48	our homes
472.48 475.04	is a hot bit of dangerous contaminants
475.04 476.24	small debris such as
476.24 478.32	dust harmful gases such as carbon
478.32 479.60	monoxide and
479.60 482.96	spores from mold
482.96 485.12	they can enter our lungs leading to
485.12 486.40	respiratory problems
486.40 490.84	and chronic conditions such as heart
490.84 492.72	disease
492.72 494.40	and these days air purifiers don't just
494.40 496.00	come with heater filters they come with
496.00 497.44	ionizers with uv
497.44 500.08	light with ozone generators and they
500.08 500.80	claim to
500.80 504.08	kill microorganisms and remove harmful
504.08 505.28	chemicals
505.28 507.60	all of which can cost a hundred to over
507.60 509.52	a thousand singapore dollars
509.52 511.60	the bigger the coverage area the higher
511.60 514.24	the cost
514.24 516.96	so which one do i choose for my home
516.96 518.24	[Music]
518.24 521.76	only one way to find out
521.76 539.68	i'm putting this machine to the test
539.68 541.76	i've discovered that air purifiers with
541.76 543.04	the hepa filter
543.04 544.80	can help filter out the much-feared
544.80 547.44	corvette 19 virus from the air
547.44 549.76	but how effective is it against regular
549.76 550.72	dust gas
550.72 554.72	and biological pollutants such as more
554.72 557.28	air purifiers now come with add-ons like
557.28 559.84	ultraviolet light ozone generators and
559.84 561.20	ionizers
561.20 566.48	but do i really need them
566.48 568.40	helping me figure this out is professor
568.40 569.52	david chong
569.52 571.84	he's done extensive research on ways to
571.84 573.76	improve indoor air quality in the
573.76 575.52	tropics
575.52 577.12	i'm meeting him today with muhammad
577.12 578.80	jufri ahmad bajuri
578.80 580.40	he's been thinking of getting an air
580.40 582.00	purifier for his home
582.00 584.24	because his father-in-law and wife both
584.24 586.08	suffer from asthma
586.08 588.40	he believes an air purifier can rid his
588.40 590.32	home of allergens like dust
590.32 593.04	which usually triggers an attack but
593.04 594.88	he's not quite sure yet
594.88 598.72	if it's worth the investment
598.72 600.56	there are so many air purifiers out in
600.56 602.16	the market these days how should i go
602.16 603.04	about choosing one
603.04 604.72	it's my personal opinion i would say the
604.72 606.88	conventional hipaa filter okay
606.88 609.36	right with activator carbon what is
609.36 611.20	important is really something that is uh
611.20 613.12	have been tested and proven which is the
613.12 614.24	conventional
614.24 616.24	hipaa filter and what we see in the back
616.24 617.84	here i mean these are the dirt
617.84 620.00	especially the outer frying particles
620.00 621.76	that can be arrested by this
621.76 625.84	hippa filter as the dirt accumulates
625.84 626.72	over time
626.72 628.96	the filter degrades and has to be
628.96 630.72	replaced with a new one
630.72 632.40	very often some of these come with not
632.40 634.00	just the hipaa filter but also
634.00 636.48	activated carbon activated carbon does
636.48 638.00	absorb pollutants from the air
638.00 640.00	in fact we use it a lot in commercial
640.00 642.16	building when they have basically odour
642.16 644.00	they may to some extent remove some of
644.00 644.64	the
644.64 646.56	chemicals but do take note our
646.56 648.16	environment is very hot and humid
648.16 649.76	so moisture content in the air is
649.76 651.52	relatively high they will deteriorate
651.52 652.16	with time
652.16 653.52	i've heard about other you know
653.52 655.44	purifiers coming with things like ozone
655.44 656.56	generator
656.56 659.84	ionized air or uv light do i need them
659.84 661.44	in my air purifier there's a word of
661.44 662.00	caution
662.00 663.92	that they may be effective but they're
663.92 665.52	also side effects for some of them
665.52 667.28	you need to check with the professionals
667.28 671.76	if you want to use those technologies
671.76 674.20	while ultraviolet light can kill harmful
674.20 676.48	microorganisms
676.48 679.52	it can also hurt our eyes and skin
679.52 681.68	injuring the cornea and increasing the
681.68 685.28	risk of skin cancer
685.28 687.28	ionizers and ozone generators on the
687.28 689.44	other hand produce ozone
689.44 691.52	and breathing in too much ozone can
691.52 693.44	affect how our lungs function
693.44 704.40	and make it more prone to infection
704.40 706.72	so for a home setting all we need is
706.72 709.04	essentially a basic heaper filter with
709.04 712.16	activated carbon
712.16 714.32	one that is suited for duffy's bedroom
714.32 716.08	costs about 500 singapore
716.08 718.96	dollars only one thing left to do and
718.96 721.12	that's to test this in geoffrey's home
721.12 723.12	and to see just how effective it is in
723.12 725.20	removing dust and other pollutants like
725.20 726.96	bacteria and gases
726.96 733.12	which could be dangerous to our health
733.12 736.08	hi hi jeffrey hey hi you're here i am
736.08 739.52	here with the air purifier
739.52 743.44	i'm not doofy's only visitor today
743.44 745.76	joey fung is an independent air quality
745.76 746.80	inspector
746.80 748.80	she runs tests to find out how much
748.80 750.88	contaminants there are in the air
750.88 755.84	in an enclosed space hi hi are you joey
755.84 757.76	today she's going to help me test the
757.76 760.00	effectiveness of the air purifier
760.00 762.00	by taking air pollutant readings in
762.00 763.68	duffy's home before
763.68 768.96	and after we run the machine
768.96 773.84	this is my bedroom okay
773.84 775.12	so this is where you spend a lot of time
775.12 776.80	and i guess you want the air to be good
776.80 779.04	you know
779.04 780.72	joey how do we check the air quality in
780.72 782.40	this room firstly the ac has to be
782.40 784.40	turned on and the door has to be closed
784.40 786.16	because we need to contain the space
786.16 788.56	so this is to test your temperature
788.56 791.12	relative humidity and come out outside
791.12 794.24	for this is air velocity and velocity
794.24 795.60	like whether it's a breeze or not
795.60 796.56	exactly whether
796.56 798.64	it's stuffy whether that's strong okay
798.64 800.40	so this is carbon monoxide
800.40 803.04	this will be testing for vocs and
803.04 804.72	formula height harmful gases
804.72 806.00	if the results are bad we should be
806.00 807.68	concerned about that one and this is
807.68 809.04	also for a dust level
809.04 811.84	your pm 2.5 and your pm10 so you can
811.84 814.08	tell whether this is a dusty roof yes we
814.08 814.48	can
814.48 816.56	especially if you know you have sinuses
816.56 818.56	asthmatic you know the triggers you want
818.56 820.64	to know your dust level
820.64 824.80	oh yeah all this dust problem
824.80 827.28	next joey sets up a device that can tell
827.28 827.84	how much
827.84 830.72	mole and bacteria there is in the room
830.72 832.08	basically we will put the agar plate
832.08 832.88	inside
832.88 834.40	and then it will suck the air and
834.40 835.92	whatever is being transmitted onto the
835.92 837.04	agar plate and then we send it back to
837.04 838.72	our lab to analyze it
838.72 842.71	so now we wait
842.71 849.92	[Music]
849.92 851.92	once the checks are complete it's time
851.92 854.48	to turn on the air purifier
854.48 856.56	there we go leave it running for a while
856.56 861.20	i'll put it on auto
861.20 863.12	for this experiment we will leave the
863.12 864.96	air purifier running for about an
864.96 867.20	hour and that should give a machine of
867.20 869.84	this size enough time to purify the air
869.84 873.28	in juffrey's room
873.28 875.44	joey heads back in to take the pollutant
875.44 876.32	readings
876.32 878.24	it will take about a week for the test
878.24 880.00	results to be processed
880.00 883.76	[Music]
883.76 885.92	meantime i'm leaving the air purifier
885.92 886.88	with juffy
886.88 889.12	so that he can use it for longer to see
889.12 891.36	if there is any discernible difference
891.36 894.32	in the air quality of his home and we're
894.32 895.60	about to find out
895.60 898.32	that he's in for a shock i hear you've
898.32 900.40	got the result from your test right this
900.40 901.52	is alarming it's
901.52 916.48	almost four times over the limit
916.48 918.80	one week ago i started my journey to
918.80 920.08	find out how effective
920.08 922.72	air purifiers are in removing dust and
922.72 924.56	other airborne pollutants
924.56 926.64	i conducted an experiment in muhammad
926.64 928.72	jufi ahmad bajuri's flat
928.72 930.80	his father-in-law and wife both suffer
930.80 931.84	from asthma
931.84 934.32	so he's hoping that an air purifier can
934.32 937.20	help to alleviate their symptoms
937.20 939.36	since we last met joffrey's been using
939.36 940.56	the air purifier
940.56 942.96	regularly at home so you've had the air
942.96 944.64	purifier for about a week now have you
944.64 946.32	noticed any improvement in the air at
946.32 946.64	home
946.64 949.12	wow yes a lot of improvements steve yeah
949.12 951.04	my family seems to be more
951.04 954.16	restful and calm is it yes okay well
954.16 955.44	let's find out what the results actually
955.44 958.91	tell us sure let's go yeah let's go
958.91 961.44	[Music]
961.44 963.68	hi joey joey hi nice to see you guys
963.68 965.60	again yeah i hear you've got the results
965.60 966.80	from your test right
966.80 969.44	overall in general the number seems good
969.44 971.44	but there are a few parameters that i
971.44 972.56	want to highlight
972.56 975.36	that it's a bit concerning you see in a
975.36 976.16	rate
976.16 979.20	color size what is tvoc right it's total
979.20 981.04	volatile organic compounds
981.04 983.84	which means chemical gases which can be
983.84 987.12	commonly found in like a disinfectant
987.12 990.40	perfume sprays herjan all these
990.40 991.52	household products
991.52 994.72	so the ideal is 1000 parts per billion
994.72 997.36	this obviously has exceeded limit of a
997.36 998.88	thousand ppp
998.88 1000.88	this is alarming it's just almost four
1000.88 1003.28	times over the limit
1003.28 1005.60	is it dangerous prolonged exposure for
1005.60 1007.12	elevator amount yes
1007.12 1008.96	even with the air purifier turned on
1008.96 1011.28	it's still on the high side
1011.28 1013.36	so you might have to take note on that
1013.36 1014.72	what are the other things that may
1014.72 1016.32	contribute to to this number
1016.32 1019.04	formula is a subset of tvoc commonly
1019.04 1019.52	found
1019.52 1022.96	in newly ventilated spaces varnishes
1022.96 1024.96	newly painted house newly bought
1024.96 1027.36	furnitures that gives off the gases
1027.36 1030.00	but in this particular case because your
1030.00 1031.52	formula height is zero
1031.52 1033.36	so it's largely still on like your
1033.36 1035.28	household products what about cleaning
1035.28 1036.56	if you clean the floor with
1036.56 1038.96	detergent yes all these have very little
1038.96 1040.80	amount that contributes together
1040.80 1043.52	there's one more one the other one it's
1043.52 1044.72	total bacteria count
1044.72 1046.72	anyway it has reduced significantly
1046.72 1048.48	after the airport fires on
1048.48 1051.92	that's actually quite a significant drop
1051.92 1053.12	i'm impressed
1053.12 1054.72	geoffrey had switched on the air
1054.72 1056.48	purifier in his room for just
1056.48 1059.52	one hour and the results overall were
1059.52 1061.68	quite positive
1061.68 1063.92	the levels of chemical gases such as
1063.92 1064.72	benzene
1064.72 1068.16	dust bacteria and mole all dropped
1068.16 1069.52	so geoffrey what do you think actually
1069.52 1071.20	i'm quite surprised all this while i've
1071.20 1072.24	been
1072.24 1074.56	not knowing that i'm having this air
1074.56 1076.64	pollution in my own home
1076.64 1079.20	but since the air profile was installed
1079.20 1080.00	in my home for
1080.00 1082.64	the past one week i realized changes in
1082.64 1083.92	my family for sure
1083.92 1085.44	especially my dad once in a while he
1085.44 1086.96	will start to sneeze yeah
1086.96 1089.04	and that sneeze will you know become
1089.04 1090.80	more stronger and stronger he will be
1090.80 1094.40	we need a pump asthma
1094.40 1096.88	but this week i mean it's a bit quieter
1096.88 1097.68	for me oh
1097.68 1099.20	i can sleep with them so are you
1099.20 1100.56	convinced you think you would like to
1100.56 1102.32	have an air purifier running you know
1102.32 1103.20	all the time
1103.20 1105.60	i'm very very convinced joey's test
1105.60 1107.92	proved that the air purifier really does
1107.92 1110.72	help to clean the air
1110.72 1113.20	but i wonder if there are alternatives
1113.20 1115.20	out there for those of us who don't want
1115.20 1117.36	to spend hundreds of dollars on an air
1117.36 1118.80	purifier
1118.80 1120.64	i'm going to try and find out from an
1120.64 1124.08	international authority on indoor air
1124.08 1126.32	professor chandrasekhar is an indoor air
1126.32 1127.52	quality consultant
1127.52 1130.00	who also studies heating ventilation and
1130.00 1131.68	air conditioning systems
1131.68 1133.12	what are the other options besides
1133.12 1134.72	having an air purifier at home
1134.72 1137.52	the fundamental word is ventilation and
1137.52 1139.36	ventilation means you've got to let the
1139.36 1140.80	air from outside
1140.80 1143.04	come into the house into the rooms and
1143.04 1145.28	that provide that kind of dilution that
1145.28 1146.48	can take place
1146.48 1148.40	let me talk about this unit that we are
1148.40 1150.96	seeing here this is fan filter unit
1150.96 1153.12	there is a fan and there's also a filter
1153.12 1154.88	okay and what it does is it takes the
1154.88 1156.40	air from outside
1156.40 1158.16	and then you have air from outside
1158.16 1161.04	providing nice ventilation into the room
1161.04 1162.72	so you see that the air is actually
1162.72 1164.24	blowing into the room
1164.24 1166.08	right and this is coming from outside
1166.08 1167.60	and this is what ventilation is all
1167.60 1169.12	about
1169.12 1171.20	this fan filter unit is a motorized
1171.20 1172.56	research prototype
1172.56 1175.04	for removing harmful airborne particles
1175.04 1176.96	from recirculating air
1176.96 1180.00	and it is not yet available commercially
1180.00 1181.28	i'm sure it costs quite a bit of money
1181.28 1183.04	too right there is a cost to it but it
1183.04 1183.92	requires a
1183.92 1186.40	proper installation you cannot just pick
1186.40 1187.52	it up from somewhere
1187.52 1190.00	and install it yourself are there other
1190.00 1191.60	alternatives that will allow
1191.60 1194.16	for this same idea to work similar
1194.16 1194.72	effect
1194.72 1197.36	certainly we open the windows everywhere
1197.36 1197.92	in the hub
1197.92 1200.56	sure what we expect is air from outside
1200.56 1202.32	through natural ventilation
1202.32 1205.36	comes into the house now it'll be great
1205.36 1207.36	if we had very high wind speeds
1207.36 1209.28	but in singapore we don't usually
1209.28 1210.88	experience high wind speeds
1210.88 1213.44	as you can see not much you depend on
1213.44 1215.20	the wind speed and the direction of the
1215.20 1215.60	wind
1215.60 1217.76	to let the outside air come in we can
1217.76 1218.88	facilitate that
1218.88 1222.08	by perhaps placing a pedestal fire
1222.08 1224.40	and you can expect the same thing to
1224.40 1226.32	function a little bit like the
1226.32 1229.04	fan filter to draw the air in the idea
1229.04 1231.20	is facilitate cross-ventilation whenever
1231.20 1232.00	you can
1232.00 1233.44	that's the whole purpose of what we're
1233.44 1235.20	talking about here does the air
1235.20 1236.80	conditioner or the air conditioning
1236.80 1237.52	system
1237.52 1240.32	provide any kind of filtration for the
1240.32 1242.32	air that i'm breathing there is a filter
1242.32 1242.72	that's
1242.72 1244.96	attached to the air conditioning unit
1244.96 1247.04	but that's the basic minimum
1247.04 1248.80	they wouldn't be removing the fine
1248.80 1252.80	particles
1252.80 1255.12	professor chandra's research also shows
1255.12 1256.48	that when you sleep in an
1256.48 1258.08	air-conditioned room
1258.08 1260.72	the amount of carbon dioxide can be up
1260.72 1262.24	to six times more
1262.24 1264.80	than the levels outdoors lowering the
1264.80 1267.52	relative concentration of fresh air
1267.52 1269.76	and triggering headaches and possibly
1269.76 1272.64	fatigue
1272.64 1275.36	would it make sense then to therefore be
1275.36 1276.96	in the air condition room
1276.96 1279.36	for a few hours and then stop it switch
1279.36 1280.96	it off that's the right strategy
1280.96 1282.48	just have to be mindful of the fact when
1282.48 1284.16	you open the windows don't open it
1284.16 1285.12	straight away
1285.12 1286.80	after turning the air conditioning off
1286.80 1288.96	right for the simple reason our outside
1288.96 1289.76	air is very
1289.76 1292.64	hot and humid warm and humid if you like
1292.64 1294.00	if that egg comes in
1294.00 1296.40	the surfaces are cold there could be
1296.40 1298.40	potentially some condensation
1298.40 1300.40	over time and then we have other issues
1300.40 1303.76	like mold growing and stuff like that
1303.76 1306.72	chemicals harmful gases dirt mole and
1306.72 1307.84	bacteria
1307.84 1310.16	we can't see them but they're all in the
1310.16 1311.12	air
1311.12 1312.56	and in our homes they can also be
1312.56 1314.16	created as we do things we
1314.16 1320.08	can't avoid like cooking and cleaning
1320.08 1322.56	so do i need an air purifier at home
1322.56 1324.40	well i've discovered that this machine
1324.40 1326.96	can help remove the bad air so
1326.96 1330.84	perhaps it's time i start using mine
1330.84 1332.16	again
1332.16 1333.36	but i've also learned that it's
1333.36 1335.12	incredibly important to keep your home
1335.12 1336.40	well ventilated
1336.40 1339.88	so that every breath you take can be a
1339.88 1342.88	fresher
