23.75 72.01	and obviously for each other and
72.01 77.36	[Music]
77.36 80.73	virtually we have told our sibling
80.73 84.90	members because we can always do a zoom
84.90 88.56	meeting second break is actually a time
88.56 90.81	of stripping away so that we can draw
90.81 94.02	near prayer slowed down basically a
94.02 96.42	circuit breaker has helped me to reflect
96.42 99.66	on this essential concept of how tests
99.66 102.39	help us to grow so they have learned
102.39 104.91	from the teachers from the temple
104.91 107.67	already that is the time to put into
107.67 109.68	practice I have realized that the things
109.68 112.68	that taught in Buddhism are directly and
112.68 114.36	immediately applicable in the real world
114.36 116.13	especially in these cohesive visions of
116.13 118.11	these black impermanence the need for
118.11 120.06	kindness the need for peace you hold by
120.06 121.95	certain values those values don't change
121.95 124.50	the cause of kovat right and we try to
124.50 126.42	reinforce those values we spend a lot of
126.42 129.45	time learning about the gospel together
129.45 132.03	as a father I have a chance to also
132.03 132.69	share it
132.69 134.67	and I felt very happy very blessed to be
134.67 136.11	able to do something right
136.11 137.88	it's a very good learning for us and
137.88 139.47	especially the principles on which
139.47 141.99	Jainism is based on non-violence
141.99 143.07	non-attachment
143.07 145.23	many sidedness of what we see around the
145.23 146.82	world other things I shall use
146.82 148.95	chardikala right this is having a
148.95 150.66	positive mindset outlook it's something
150.66 152.04	that we constantly remind ourselves as
152.04 154.49	well sorry uncle or big brother state
154.49 157.17	ridiculous period we'll ask my advice to
157.17 159.56	the community keep and observe this
159.56 162.42	fundamental ethical foundation of
162.42 164.49	religion avoidance of harm and
164.49 167.07	protection of public interests why God
167.07 169.47	is allowing the situation to happen you
169.47 170.76	know when you have a matching our
170.76 172.35	computers and from a sensor is not
172.35 175.13	working properly what do you do to set I
175.13 177.36	think God cause perish the bottom of
177.36 180.57	reset for a while now it's up to us
180.57 182.58	whether we in this recycling we really
182.58 185.52	operate better it's easy you may be
185.52 187.47	despondent you know I think like as
187.47 190.17	members of community more than just you
190.17 191.49	know the Baha'i community if I just even
191.49 193.02	my neighbors of whatever backgrounds
193.02 196.23	they be we have a responsibility to help
196.23 198.57	each other feel whole
198.57 200.37	there's some good I came out of it
200.37 202.20	because some people who could never go
202.20 214.05	for each acts of kindness are players
214.05 216.21	there's gonna have to be that physically
216.21 219.03	in a place of worship God's in sahaja
219.03 227.22	yoga one thing is for sure that circuit
227.22 229.02	breaker or even this for which it's only
229.02 229.80	a temporary thing
229.80 231.75	I think humankind is something which can
231.75 233.91	adapt to any situation I'm really proud
233.91 237.48	to see many of my fellow Singaporeans
237.48 240.05	the colors of this language or religion
240.05 242.85	there came over during this
242.85 244.79	extraordinary time
244.79 249.29	to offer assistance to anyone in times
249.29 254.09	of crisis we yield humanity people were
254.09 258.11	telling me she we just remove 2024 our
258.11 261.02	calendars since this is going to be a
261.02 263.24	waste and I have been sharing with many
263.24 265.40	people that I think we will remember the
265.40 266.36	rest of our lives
266.36 269.18	for me this Holy Week shall be maybe the
269.18 271.64	most meaningful ever even we are here in
271.64 284.41	the situation we continue we are safe
