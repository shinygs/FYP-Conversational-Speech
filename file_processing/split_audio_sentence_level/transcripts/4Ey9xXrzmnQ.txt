4.48 5.12	today
5.12 7.52	a million wildlife species are facing
7.52 10.24	the threat of extinction
10.24 13.04	what's frightening they're dying off
13.04 14.08	faster than
14.08 17.52	ever before
17.52 19.52	it's just a really unnerving feeling
19.52 21.68	knowing that somewhere down the road
21.68 23.84	the animals that we have today may only
23.84 25.44	exist behind glass like what we're
25.44 27.60	seeing here
27.60 30.32	but we live in a tiny city-state i
30.32 30.96	wonder
30.96 33.20	how can we possibly make biodiversity an
33.20 35.20	issue that matters to more people in
35.20 37.20	singapore
37.20 39.84	i'm shushan born and bred in singapore
39.84 41.44	and in my time as a journalist
41.44 43.52	my favorite stories to cover were always
43.52 45.36	the ones about nature
45.36 47.12	i discovered a secret sanctuary for
47.12 48.72	gibbons rescued from poachers in
48.72 51.28	malaysia
51.28 53.76	explored the mountains of borneo we
53.76 54.64	reached 10
54.64 58.00	of our journey and spend my holidays
58.00 62.16	in other natural wonders abroad
62.16 65.84	covert 19 put an end to my trips abroad
65.84 68.16	but being stuck in singapore has turned
68.16 68.88	out to be an
68.88 71.12	eye-opening experience this is looking
71.12 73.04	at us with his eyes wide open
73.04 76.56	oh it's so cute in this two-part
76.56 77.84	documentary i come
77.84 79.92	face to face with some of the rarest
79.92 81.36	species in the world
81.36 83.52	right here in singapore to think that
83.52 86.00	they exist amongst us you know forests
86.00 88.24	blows my mind really and meet the
88.24 90.08	tenacious men and women in the uphill
90.08 91.84	battle to save these creatures from
91.84 93.44	extinction
93.44 96.24	these crabs are only found in singapore
96.24 98.40	in the last 200 years we have lost
98.40 101.12	nearly a third of our native wildlife
101.12 102.72	can we make it in time to stop the
102.72 103.92	remaining species
103.92 106.08	from disappearing forever it was thought
106.08 108.36	to be the last one of its tribe
108.36 112.08	[Music]
112.08 114.16	in the history of humanity we've been
114.16 116.16	exploiting the bounties of nature for
116.16 117.44	our needs
117.44 120.96	you could almost say it's in our nature
120.96 122.64	but have we come to a point where we've
122.64 124.72	gone too far
124.72 126.40	what do we stand to lose when our own
126.40 129.76	flora and fauna go extinct
129.76 132.08	and what role can our tiny city-state
132.08 134.24	possibly play in preserving our planet's
134.24 136.64	biodiversity
136.64 138.80	that's what i'll try to find out in it's
138.80 159.68	in our nature
159.68 162.72	i love spending my mornings here

204.72 207.28	organized by nature society singapore
207.28 210.84	and participants raced to well spot the
210.84 212.16	birds
212.16 213.84	each species has assigned a point
213.84 215.76	between one and five depending on how
215.76 217.28	common or rare they are
217.28 220.72	and the team with the most points wins
220.72 221.92	they started bird watching at noon

252.84 254.08	whoa
254.08 255.84	dingley has been bird watching for more
255.84 258.00	than two decades but what started as a
258.00 258.64	hobby
258.64 261.68	eventually became his day job today he
261.68 263.28	works with bird life international
263.28 265.60	a bird conservation ngo so i really
265.60 267.60	can't get a better guide for my virgin
267.60 268.38	bird race
268.38 272.00	[Music]
272.00 274.24	oh you see there's four birds in the sky
274.24 275.60	yeah yeah
275.60 279.52	five point five points all right
279.52 282.00	wow we've got this five point birds man
282.00 283.28	this is what it looks like
283.28 286.80	oh nice oh you heard that high-pitched
286.80 289.60	call yeah that's good i see it yeah
289.60 292.16	it's been an hour of straining our necks
292.16 292.88	but
292.88 295.68	it's paid off we've spotted 20 species
295.68 297.36	of forest birds
297.36 299.52	and you could say by this time dingley
299.52 301.60	could add one more bird watching convert
301.60 303.64	to its list
303.64 316.83	[Music]
316.83 318.16	[Music]
318.16 320.08	i don't think i've ever been so excited
320.08 321.52	about our feathered creatures
321.52 323.84	i've been told in the last decade more
323.84 326.00	than 400 species of birds have been
326.00 329.36	recorded on our island
329.36 331.68	we spotted another 15 more species
331.68 334.08	before heading to sugaibulo
334.08 338.32	a hot spot for migratory birds dingley
338.32 338.96	tells me
338.96 340.80	more than a hundred different species
340.80 343.04	stop over here on our island
343.04 344.40	on their way to other parts of the
344.40 346.32	region you see all the brown birds on
346.32 346.80	the mud
346.80 348.56	yeah so they're very small near to the
348.56 349.92	water stage there's a
349.92 352.88	like 60 70 brown birds there so these
352.88 354.40	are wimbros and wind bros are
354.40 357.12	strawberries that live in the high
357.12 358.00	tundra of
358.00 361.28	of siberia wow so literally
361.28 363.92	right at the top of the continent and to
363.92 365.28	come here they will have to fly
365.28 367.60	more than six seven thousand kilometers
367.60 369.28	one way
369.28 371.52	previously singapore was thought to be a
371.52 373.76	stopover only on the east asian
373.76 375.44	australasian flyway
375.44 377.84	but a new study just published found
377.84 379.12	that some birds which spend their
379.12 380.40	winters in singapore
380.40 381.84	actually made their way from the
381.84 383.76	himalayas making us
383.76 387.28	part of the central asian flyway as well
387.28 390.00	all in all thousands of migratory birds
390.00 392.40	stop over on our island between august
392.40 393.12	and march
393.12 396.24	every year i guess you could say we are
396.24 396.48	an
396.48 399.76	air hub in more ways than we realized
399.76 401.44	why does our island matter to these
401.44 403.84	migratory birds so singapore by virtue
403.84 404.96	of our position
404.96 408.08	makes us really an important
408.08 409.92	pop-up point for birds on their
409.92 412.40	migrations you see we are right at the
412.40 414.24	tip of the malay peninsula
414.24 415.60	so a lot of these birds that are moving
415.60 417.28	down the peninsula they would
417.28 419.60	you know fly through singapore and this
419.60 421.36	is the last chance for them
421.36 423.84	to refuel before they go to indonesia
423.84 425.12	they have to fly across the sea and
425.12 426.08	flying across the sea
426.08 428.96	is not easy for monkey tree birds all
428.96 430.64	pit stops equally important
430.64 433.20	for the case of birds of prey for
433.20 433.92	example
433.92 435.28	we are beginning to find that singapore
435.28 437.84	is a very important pit stop for
437.84 440.88	eagles and hawks going on to indonesia
440.88 443.20	on certain days account up to a thousand
443.20 444.88	eagles passing through singapore on
444.88 447.35	their way to indonesia wow
447.35 449.04	[Music]
449.04 451.33	so we're going here yep
451.33 453.44	[Music]
453.44 454.72	okay so we're just in the last few
454.72 456.24	minutes of the race and we've just
456.24 457.60	chosen this spot to
457.60 459.68	kind of try and spot a few more birds in
459.68 462.32	the last six minutes
462.32 464.24	hey i'll see see you see you next time
464.24 466.24	that's the lesser egyptian
466.24 467.44	all right robert you got to put that in
467.44 470.72	now lester edgerton
470.72 472.56	what about this one here oh little
472.56 474.40	harrison little herrera
474.40 476.32	have you seen that oh common common
476.32 478.00	sandpiper
478.00 480.80	yeah yeah another one yeah you see they
480.80 481.52	know the burrito is
481.52 482.64	ending they're all just showing up
482.64 485.12	finally like okay last year
485.12 486.48	robert you want to submit the results
486.48 488.64	now did you finalize the list then i go
488.64 491.36	and check it
491.36 494.00	all right there we go i've submitted the
494.00 495.76	final list for today's race
495.76 498.96	so uh we've got about 40 birds all
498.96 500.16	together which is
500.16 502.40	not a bad count well then guys well done
502.40 506.72	i think we all deserve a drink
506.72 508.40	you know before this i may have thought
508.40 510.08	so what a bird is a bird
510.08 512.24	but what i've discovered today is that
512.24 513.68	there are so many different types of
513.68 515.68	species of birds and within the species
515.68 516.24	itself
516.24 519.44	there are multiple subspecies it's
519.44 520.00	opened my
520.00 522.08	eyes to how little i know about our
522.08 525.76	native wildlife
525.76 528.56	i want to find out more and i'm choosing
528.56 529.28	to start
529.28 539.84	at the museum of the living dead
539.84 541.84	oh it says here that we may have over 40
541.84 544.16	000 species of plants and animals
544.16 546.23	i didn't know that
546.23 547.52	[Music]
547.52 549.60	this museum showcases a collection of
549.60 551.84	wildlife specimens from across southeast
551.84 552.64	asia
552.64 554.80	including flora and fauna native to
554.80 556.96	singapore
556.96 559.28	and i've asked to meet professor leo tan
559.28 560.88	a man some might call
560.88 564.00	the godfather of local biodiversity he's
564.00 565.76	among the first few singaporeans to
565.76 568.18	fight to save our wildlife
568.18 570.24	[Music]
570.24 572.08	so the exhibition says we may have over
572.08 574.08	40 000 plant and animal species in
574.08 574.80	singapore
574.80 578.64	we have more trees in singapore species
578.64 580.48	than the whole of north america in one
580.48 581.92	square kilometer
581.92 583.92	because we're in the tropics we have a
583.92 586.64	greater biodiversity
586.64 589.76	we have such a rich diversity of corals
589.76 593.12	almost 250 species which form almost a
593.12 593.60	third
593.60 595.60	of the total corals in the world we
595.60 596.88	probably have a third
596.88 599.36	of the species of crab in southeast asia
599.36 603.28	not all of them edible
603.28 605.60	why do we have such rich biodiversity in
605.60 607.28	spite of being a city-state
607.28 609.36	we were once part of the natural
609.36 610.40	rainforest
610.40 612.80	tropical rainforest malaysia and
612.80 613.84	singapore
613.84 616.00	were joined at one point in time in our
616.00 617.68	geological history
617.68 620.00	not only all the way to australia
620.00 622.96	dinosaurs once walked through singapore
622.96 625.80	we call the abundance of wildlife
625.80 627.68	biodiversity
627.68 630.16	and over the last 200 years singapore
630.16 630.72	has lost
630.72 633.51	almost a third of native wildlife
633.51 644.40	[Music]
644.40 646.72	now the only chance we might get to see
646.72 647.52	them
647.52 651.44	is through the eyes of kate pocklington
651.44 654.08	she's handled at least 50 000 species of
654.08 655.04	wildlife
655.04 658.84	all of them dead and many locally
658.84 661.04	extinct
661.04 664.24	kate is an animal artisan she restores
664.24 665.52	animal carcasses
665.52 667.20	and then works to portray them in their
667.20 669.52	natural state
669.52 671.52	today she's preparing some specimens for
671.52 675.92	an upcoming exhibition
675.92 679.76	okay so we've got um the malayan tiger
679.76 681.76	cream colored squirrel and these two are
681.76 683.92	both extinct in singapore
683.92 687.76	1909 wow very old this is an ancient
687.76 689.84	specimen
689.84 693.28	my goodness specimen 1
693.28 695.04	one of the largest squirrels in the
695.04 695.90	world
695.90 697.36	[Music]
697.36 699.76	first discovered by sir stamford raffles
699.76 701.44	in 1821
701.44 703.84	it was said to be abundantly present in
703.84 706.16	the woods
706.16 707.84	so the first thing we're going to do is
707.84 709.20	like basic
709.20 712.24	just give it a clean so just yeah just
712.24 713.84	go with the
713.84 715.76	direction of the fur i feel like i'm
715.76 718.40	grooming my cat
718.40 720.56	in fact they were so common that up
720.56 722.08	until the late 60s
722.08 725.12	they were sold as food or pets
725.12 727.04	but the species hasn't been spotted on
727.04 728.84	our island since
728.84 732.96	1995 specimen 2
732.96 736.72	a malayan tiger
736.72 738.24	they're only found in the malay
738.24 741.28	peninsula the first recorded sighting
741.28 745.52	1831 after it mauled someone to death
745.52 747.36	and as development encroached on their
747.36 749.68	habitats these attacks became
749.68 752.48	increasingly common a bounty was even
752.48 755.04	given for every tiger killed
755.04 757.84	the last one on our island was shot in
757.84 760.40	1930
760.40 763.84	my job today to make this sculpted tooth
763.84 766.88	as realistic as possible that one
766.88 769.12	over there is missing a tooth when it's
769.12 770.16	on display
770.16 771.12	it really wants to look kind of
771.12 773.12	scientifically accurate so i got this
773.12 774.32	one out to show you
774.32 787.60	how the teeth should look wow
787.60 790.56	should i um oh sorry am i taking no
790.56 794.16	you're not taking too long no not at all
794.16 796.64	i'll just do a few lines on his okay
796.64 801.52	then we can try it
801.52 804.80	so cool she's really bringing it to life
804.80 806.96	right now
806.96 812.08	look at that it's amazing kate
812.08 813.28	why do you think it's important that
813.28 815.60	other people get to see these specimens
815.60 817.68	if they're already extinct then this is
817.68 819.12	the only chance that we've got to see
819.12 820.16	them right
820.16 822.96	so it's kind of important that i do
822.96 824.00	whatever i can
824.00 826.08	to keep them this way and so that people
826.08 827.44	in the future will understand what we
827.44 828.32	had
828.32 829.76	yeah it's very different from looking at
829.76 832.96	a photo you know yeah
832.96 834.64	when it's just in little bits and pieces
834.64 835.92	it's kind of hard to tell what you're
835.92 837.44	looking at but now that we've really put
837.44 838.40	it together
838.40 839.76	it's really starting to take the shape
839.76 843.52	of a tiger i might not have been much
843.52 844.40	help
844.40 846.40	but i'm feeling proud that i've had a
846.40 848.96	hand in preserving our natural heritage
848.96 851.36	especially since more than a thousand
851.36 853.20	six hundred native species
853.20 855.28	are on the edge of extinction according
855.28 857.28	to the singapore red data book
857.28 860.80	last published in 2008
860.80 863.36	one of them is this raffles bandit
863.36 864.80	langer
864.80 868.16	only 67 are left in the wild
868.16 872.00	so this one at the back died in 1987.
872.00 873.36	and it's actually one of the old
873.36 875.12	curators of the museum saw it
875.12 877.52	um it was thought to be the last one of
877.52 880.40	its tribe
880.40 881.76	so kate why do you think we've lost so
881.76 883.68	many species of animals in singapore
883.68 886.64	habitat loss for different animals and
886.64 888.24	urbanization happened
888.24 891.20	quite fast land use changes
891.20 892.72	deforestation
892.72 895.76	so with habitat loss makes it more
895.76 897.36	difficult for animals to find
897.36 903.52	you know food not as much space to live
903.52 906.16	our island was once covered in forests
906.16 907.84	but after the british arrived
907.84 910.56	most of it was raised to the ground
910.56 914.00	replaced by profitable plantations
914.00 918.00	by 1900 90 of our original forest cover
918.00 922.56	was gone rapid urbanization in the 1960s
922.56 924.96	destroyed even more forests and coastal
924.96 929.84	habitats
929.84 932.32	and as we continue to encroach on their
932.32 933.60	habitats
933.60 937.68	thank you for watching
937.68 940.88	more animals are being spotted in ours
940.88 943.92	in distress oh there it is yeah i see it
943.92 947.52	oh no
947.52 950.16	it looks dead it looks dead i don't know
950.16 957.33	that's a life
957.33 967.92	[Music]
967.92 970.08	earlier i discovered that we could have
970.08 971.20	more than 40
971.20 973.36	000 species of plants and animals in
973.36 974.48	singapore
974.48 977.36	that's the good news the bad news more
977.36 979.68	than a thousand of our native wildlife
979.68 983.04	are on the brink of disappearing forever
983.04 986.16	urbanization happened land use changes
986.16 989.52	deforestation which is why today
989.52 1001.76	the folks at acres are busier than ever
1001.76 1004.08	acres runs the only wildlife rescue
1004.08 1006.24	hotline in singapore
1006.24 1008.72	a small bet you found it on the floor
1008.72 1009.44	why don't you
1009.44 1012.16	send a picture of the vat to us whatsapp
1012.16 1014.64	on this number
1014.64 1017.20	and since they started in 2009 they've
1017.20 1017.92	dealt with
1017.92 1020.80	all sorts of cases injured birds
1020.80 1022.16	distressed mammals
1022.16 1024.16	or reptiles that simply crawled their
1024.16 1027.84	way into people's homes
1027.84 1030.88	another call hello i guess hotline it
1030.88 1032.24	really seems like the calls are coming
1032.24 1033.36	in non-stop
1033.36 1035.68	yep why do you think that's the case uh
1035.68 1036.40	i think
1036.40 1038.00	one thing is definitely more people know
1038.00 1040.16	about us uh so they
1040.16 1042.96	they call us the other thing can be like
1042.96 1044.40	we're getting more urbanized
1044.40 1047.44	more land is being cleared so um
1047.44 1049.36	more animals are being seen in public
1049.36 1051.36	places not all bad i mean i guess it
1051.36 1053.04	goes to show that people do care right
1053.04 1054.64	yeah people do care and that's great
1054.64 1055.52	love uh
1055.52 1056.88	and but that's one of the reasons why
1056.88 1058.88	our call volume has increased also
1058.88 1061.36	um so i mean we are trying our best to
1061.36 1065.68	help us reach out to as many as possible
1065.68 1068.24	our first rescue of the day a python
1068.24 1069.92	that has slithered its way into a
1069.92 1071.68	backyard
1071.68 1073.84	and we're off to catch it and release it
1073.84 1082.00	back into the wild
1082.00 1084.08	so they've given me a pair of gloves i'm
1084.08 1086.48	gonna assist in some way
1086.48 1089.68	uh if it's not too dangerous of course
1089.68 1095.13	yeah this is exciting
1095.13 1110.88	[Music]
1110.88 1112.88	so the key is to just be calm just to be
1112.88 1114.24	calm yeah
1114.24 1115.76	because he doesn't see me as a threat so
1115.76 1119.92	he's pretty chill here you go
1119.92 1125.12	all right rescue one done
1125.12 1129.68	next stop a student care center
1129.68 1131.60	a baby common palm civet was found
1131.60 1134.24	ambling around
1134.24 1142.24	and it sounds like it's in distress
1142.24 1145.36	okay okay i'm just gonna give him a
1145.36 1148.84	bit of electrolyte see whether he takes
1148.84 1150.24	it
1150.24 1154.24	oh they go civics are nocturnal
1154.24 1157.84	so they aren't a common sight in the day
1157.84 1161.04	but even if you've never seen them you
1161.04 1162.72	might have tasted
1162.72 1165.52	the poop these mammals can excrete one
1165.52 1166.16	of the most
1166.16 1168.88	expensive coffee beans in the world kopi
1168.88 1170.57	luwak
1170.57 1171.76	[Music]
1171.76 1173.36	how is it he seems a bit wet so there
1173.36 1175.04	was a bit of concern now whether he
1175.04 1176.40	whether it was blood or anything like
1176.40 1178.40	that but no see no issues so
1178.40 1182.32	he looks alert civics typically live in
1182.32 1183.12	forests
1183.12 1185.28	but the adaptable creature is also
1185.28 1188.40	comfortable among trees in urban areas
1188.40 1190.56	for this babysitter kali thinks his
1190.56 1192.72	mother could be nearby
1192.72 1195.60	so they've just identified this area as
1195.60 1196.40	a possible
1196.40 1198.40	place to release a civet i mean it's
1198.40 1200.80	really ideal because it's a huge tree
1200.80 1202.40	where it can kind of climb up and make
1202.40 1206.42	itself comfortable
1206.42 1218.08	[Music]
1218.08 1227.28	but my euphoria didn't last long
1227.28 1229.68	it's a rescue that needs our immediate
1229.68 1230.48	attention
1230.48 1233.44	she sounded quite panicky if you wait
1233.44 1234.64	too long
1234.64 1236.40	the animal can die from dehydration
1236.40 1237.84	bleeding that can be
1237.84 1241.36	fatal none of my previous rescues
1241.36 1243.12	prepared me for what i'm about to see
1243.12 1244.48	next
1244.48 1250.24	oh there it is yeah i see it oh no
1250.24 1252.88	it looks dead it looks dead i don't know
1252.88 1256.24	this is life
1256.24 1259.04	it's a sunda kalugo that's on the brink
1259.04 1262.08	of death
1262.08 1264.32	alive they're saying that it's still
1264.32 1266.32	alive but it's not moving as much as it
1266.32 1267.12	was
1267.12 1268.48	i don't need to rush this because it's
1268.48 1270.48	barely alive
1270.48 1272.56	this is one of only two species of
1272.56 1274.72	kalugos found in the world
1274.72 1276.76	and these tree dwellers can travel up to
1276.76 1278.48	136 meters
1278.48 1281.20	in a single glide that's longer than the
1281.20 1286.56	length of a football field
1286.56 1288.72	carla thinks this baby might have flown
1288.72 1291.12	straight into this barbed wire
1291.12 1294.08	a 2007 study estimated that just one
1294.08 1296.64	thousand of them are left here
1296.64 1304.56	and that's why every single one matters
1304.56 1306.56	yeah it seems like one of it one of its
1306.56 1307.68	body parts is stuck
1307.68 1310.72	in the wire oh it's bad oh it is it's
1310.72 1312.32	very bad
1312.32 1315.60	so it's twisted
1315.60 1316.72	i mean i can't even imagine how
1316.72 1329.68	terrifying this must be for the creature
1329.68 1332.72	yeah there you go
1332.72 1336.00	after 15 minutes the kalugo
1336.00 1338.09	is finally released
1338.09 1339.28	[Music]
1339.28 1343.04	it's okay it's all right
1343.04 1346.56	it's gonna be okay oh
1346.56 1348.56	so we need to go back and check exactly
1348.56 1350.08	which part of the
1350.08 1352.88	the wing the potato the injuries are
1352.88 1356.00	yeah it looked quite bad
1356.00 1358.48	any delay in treatment could reduce its
1358.48 1371.44	chance of survival
1371.44 1374.41	oh boy
1374.41 1383.84	[Music]
1383.84 1385.36	yeah so you've just snipped off the
1385.36 1387.92	entire this is the part that was torn
1387.92 1388.56	and probably
1388.56 1390.96	um hooked onto the wire so it's all dead
1390.96 1391.92	membrane
1391.92 1393.76	we just removed it and there's no
1393.76 1395.44	bleeding so what's your assessment of
1395.44 1397.04	the situation so far
1397.04 1400.00	it's actually pretty good he can be
1400.00 1402.08	reunited with this mommy
1402.08 1405.44	great and after eight hours
1405.44 1408.08	three successful rescues i've come to
1408.08 1408.56	see
1408.56 1411.12	how crucial a role the team here plays
1411.12 1414.16	in preserving our wildlife
1414.16 1417.12	but just when i thought my day was over
1417.12 1418.64	well i just got a call from akers that
1418.64 1420.24	they just rescued one of the most
1420.24 1421.84	elusive creatures in the world
1421.84 1423.36	and it's now at the zoo so i'm rushing
1423.36 1424.96	there now
1424.96 1426.88	i'm about to come face to face with a
1426.88 1428.64	species that's not just critically
1428.64 1430.32	endangered here
1430.32 1437.84	but also all around the world
1437.84 1440.56	this is the sunda pangolin it's one of
1440.56 1442.40	the three critically endangered species
1442.40 1443.44	of pangolins
1443.44 1445.55	in the world
1445.55 1446.80	[Music]
1446.80 1448.56	it's very typical of pangolins to come
1448.56 1450.80	out of their natural habitat to just
1450.80 1451.44	explore
1451.44 1454.80	we're going to give him a sedative
1454.80 1456.56	pangolins are sent to the zoo whenever
1456.56 1457.84	they're rescued
1457.84 1459.52	this one was found curled up and
1459.52 1461.44	stranded on a road divider
1461.44 1465.20	and sent here to be examined
1465.20 1467.04	pangolins are the only mammals in the
1467.04 1469.68	world with these protective scales
1469.68 1471.68	and this feature has made them the most
1471.68 1474.16	traffic mammal in the world
1474.16 1476.08	more than a million of them have been
1476.08 1478.00	poached and killed for their scales in
1478.00 1480.56	the last decade
1480.56 1482.80	people actually believe that those
1482.80 1485.04	skills give people strength
1485.04 1486.32	they're actually just made out of
1486.32 1488.24	keratin which is the same thing that you
1488.24 1489.52	have with your fingernails so people
1489.52 1493.12	might as well just eat their fingernails
1493.12 1495.52	now that it's fully sedated the team
1495.52 1497.76	needs to work fast
1497.76 1499.44	two hours and longer yeah then you'll
1499.44 1501.68	start seeing blood pressure is dropping
1501.68 1503.28	even
1503.28 1506.00	and within seconds dr abraham spots the
1506.00 1507.36	first sign of trouble
1507.36 1510.48	a laceration on its tail
1510.48 1511.84	most probably the animal got himself
1511.84 1514.48	caught in some netting somewheres
1514.48 1516.24	the team needs to run more tests to
1516.24 1519.20	determine the full extent of its injury
1519.20 1521.12	so they've just taken it into a separate
1521.12 1522.96	room and they've laid it on the table i
1522.96 1524.24	think they're going to do some scans on
1524.24 1526.64	it now
1526.64 1528.32	the wound on the tail that bone is
1528.32 1529.68	slightly affected
1529.68 1532.40	you have to also make sure that the
1532.40 1534.00	internal structures are okay
1534.00 1536.32	the mood in here is quite serious i
1536.32 1537.60	guess there's a lot at stake when you're
1537.60 1539.04	dealing with an animal that is
1539.04 1541.92	really endangered so we're just going to
1541.92 1544.58	clean the room
1544.58 1548.24	[Music]
1548.24 1550.16	beside these phones he's actually in
1550.16 1551.60	very good condition
1551.60 1553.04	so you're generally quite happy with
1553.04 1556.64	what you're seeing now i guess everyone
1556.64 1557.84	in here is quite relieved that is
1557.84 1559.60	healthy enough to be rehabilitated into
1559.60 1560.88	the wild
1560.88 1563.60	the final procedure a microchip implant
1563.60 1566.00	with a unique identification code
1566.00 1568.08	it's part of regional efforts to collect
1568.08 1570.09	data on this elusive creature
1570.09 1572.80	[Music]
1572.80 1576.40	c583 it's nice to see these penguins in
1576.40 1576.96	singapore
1576.96 1578.32	actually most of them are in really good
1578.32 1579.68	condition when they come into us as
1579.68 1580.72	opposed to
1580.72 1583.12	the regional countries where they see
1583.12 1584.32	animals that come in
1584.32 1585.76	under large confiscations and the
1585.76 1588.00	animals are half dead
1588.00 1590.40	because they are endangered every single
1590.40 1591.76	individual
1591.76 1594.72	place of age if we don't intervene if we
1594.72 1595.44	don't
1595.44 1597.04	try to help it these things don't
1597.04 1599.03	actually have a chance
1599.03 1602.64	[Music]
1602.64 1605.44	habitat loss however isn't the only
1605.44 1607.68	threat to our most endangered native
1607.68 1609.36	species
1609.36 1613.28	meet the invader and you
1613.28 1624.84	might well have played a role in this
1624.84 1628.80	invasion
1628.80 1631.12	i've come face to face with rare
1631.12 1632.64	creatures this is the penguin
1632.64 1635.68	yes and rescued wildlife in distress
1635.68 1637.92	oh there you go you're getting more
1637.92 1639.04	urbanized
1639.04 1641.52	so more animals are being seen in public
1641.52 1642.56	places
1642.56 1648.32	but habitat loss isn't the only threat
1648.32 1650.88	there's also alien species that threaten
1650.88 1654.16	to evict them from their homes
1654.16 1656.72	darren is studying one particular
1656.72 1658.86	intruder
1658.86 1661.12	[Music]
1661.12 1663.84	hey darren what's a lot looking at the
1663.84 1665.28	experiment in progress now
1665.28 1667.20	the two of them are going to start
1667.20 1669.20	fighting each other
1669.20 1672.24	the defender the lowland freshwater crab
1672.24 1674.80	that's native to our island
1674.80 1678.08	the challenger the red claw crayfish
1678.08 1682.16	a species that doesn't belong here
1682.16 1685.04	the crayfish if it decides to start
1685.04 1686.24	looking for a shelter
1686.24 1690.16	it will try to evict the crab
1690.16 1692.16	these red claw crayfish were first
1692.16 1694.40	brought in through the aquarium trade
1694.40 1696.32	and released into our reservoirs by
1696.32 1699.16	irresponsible pet owners
1699.16 1700.80	[Music]
1700.80 1703.84	oh he's going straight for it oh oh he's
1703.84 1705.44	actually going in
1705.44 1708.16	oh my goodness and it doesn't take long
1708.16 1709.44	to see why these guys
1709.44 1712.48	are a threat well it looks like the crab
1712.48 1713.76	is trying to defend its home
1713.76 1715.20	the crab just doesn't want to go out
1715.20 1717.44	right when you lose your shelter that
1717.44 1726.24	makes you more prone to predation
1726.24 1728.48	is pushing the crap out and look at that
1728.48 1733.04	show of aggression right there
1733.04 1736.84	if this were the wild this crab would be
1736.84 1738.16	toast
1738.16 1740.64	should we be concerned well invasive
1740.64 1741.36	species
1741.36 1743.44	are among the top threats to
1743.44 1744.56	biodiversity
1744.56 1746.72	they are breeding in the wild and their
1746.72 1748.48	numbers are significant enough
1748.48 1751.04	that they are spreading from the
1751.04 1752.64	reservoirs where many of them were
1752.64 1755.04	initially introduced
1755.04 1757.44	to other water bodies including
1757.44 1759.36	sometimes to some of the forest streams
1759.36 1760.24	where our
1760.24 1764.08	native freshwater crabs are living
1764.08 1765.92	ultimately this becomes a concern
1765.92 1767.84	because some of our species are
1767.84 1769.60	found in singapore nowhere else in the
1769.60 1771.92	world this could even potentially lead
1771.92 1772.56	to
1772.56 1776.00	extinction it's complete extinction
1776.00 1778.16	these crayfish have already been found
1778.16 1780.00	close to the habitats of some of our
1780.00 1782.72	three native crabs that exist only in
1782.72 1783.76	singapore
1783.76 1786.88	and one of these species ranks among the
1786.88 1787.52	world's
1787.52 1791.20	hundred most endangered the singapore
1791.20 1792.80	freshwater crab
1792.80 1794.72	it was originally known to be found in
1794.72 1797.28	just three streams on our island
1797.28 1799.92	these crabs are particularly fussy about
1799.92 1801.20	where they live
1801.20 1802.96	they're sensitive to changes in the
1802.96 1804.24	environment and
1804.24 1806.16	climate change is shrinking their
1806.16 1807.52	options
1807.52 1810.00	daniel is trying to introduce them into
1810.00 1812.64	more streams across the island
1812.64 1814.16	it must be the tiniest crab i've ever
1814.16 1816.32	seen in my life it's like not even the
1816.32 1817.78	size of my eye
1817.78 1820.16	[Music]
1820.16 1822.40	he's among the first to successfully
1822.40 1824.56	breed them in captivity
1824.56 1826.72	these five to eight-month-old hatchlings
1826.72 1829.44	are his 17th and 18th batch
1829.44 1831.68	and today we're going to be releasing
1831.68 1836.04	them into the wild
1836.04 1843.76	[Music]
1843.76 1846.56	daniel you're so fast i can't even keep
1846.56 1847.60	up
1847.60 1851.12	oh my god treacherous the survival of
1851.12 1853.36	these tiny invertebrates hinges
1853.36 1856.16	on a magnitude of factors they need fast
1856.16 1858.56	flowing hill streams with the right ph
1858.56 1859.20	level
1859.20 1862.00	and a high amount of oxygen changes in
1862.00 1863.52	weather patterns could affect their
1863.52 1867.20	survival
1867.20 1868.96	okay so we have reached the place that
1868.96 1871.84	we are releasing the crabs
1871.84 1876.84	that's a lot of demands for something so
1876.84 1878.88	tiny
1878.88 1880.88	what's at stake if this species vanishes
1880.88 1882.00	from our hill streams
1882.00 1884.56	it plays a number of roles in the
1884.56 1885.36	ecosystem
1885.36 1888.08	it will feed on leaf litter as well as
1888.08 1889.76	also the animals that's present in the
1889.76 1890.40	stream
1890.40 1892.96	it is also a opportunistic predator who
1892.96 1894.40	will
1894.40 1896.72	predate on small animals inside the
1896.72 1897.68	stream so
1897.68 1900.72	all these species are
1900.72 1903.60	part of the ecosystem or interdependent
1903.60 1905.04	on each other
1905.04 1907.36	with the removal of one species such as
1907.36 1908.96	the singapore freshwater crab
1908.96 1910.80	it may have an adverse impact on the
1910.80 1912.00	stream ecosystem
1912.00 1915.04	and potentially affect the entire stream
1915.04 1916.24	ecosystem as well as
1916.24 1918.72	its other inhabitants so then with the
1918.72 1920.32	loss of one species
1920.32 1922.72	could the ecosystem collapse it's
1922.72 1924.64	possible
1924.64 1926.80	there's still so much that scientists
1926.80 1928.48	don't know
1928.48 1930.96	but if one tiny critter can potentially
1930.96 1931.84	have a huge
1931.84 1934.72	impact on our ecosystem what about the
1934.72 1936.24	most prolific group in the animal
1936.24 1937.20	kingdom
1937.20 1940.24	the insects
1940.24 1943.44	i want to find out more so i'm meeting
1943.44 1945.84	someone who cares for more than 21 000
1945.84 1946.88	insects
1946.88 1950.00	including some native species what is
1950.00 1950.56	that
1950.56 1952.32	oh this is the red ring giant green
1952.32 1954.00	stick insect oh my goodness they're
1954.00 1955.72	actually local to singapore
1955.72 1957.92	[Music]
1957.92 1960.88	also under her care are some endangered
1960.88 1963.47	species
1963.47 1964.96	[Music]
1964.96 1967.44	delvin wastes no time in putting me to
1967.44 1968.16	work
1968.16 1970.80	i will need you to help me sweep up all
1970.80 1972.56	the fresh that's accumulated
1972.56 1977.60	on the newspaper over here
1977.60 1980.32	gotta be careful not to kill any of them
1980.32 1983.44	we're killing an endangered species
1983.44 1987.20	can i move the bottles a bit yeah oh
1987.20 1990.88	there you go
1990.88 1993.36	is that clean enough does that make you
1993.36 1994.08	happy
1994.08 1997.76	uh yes most people think of insects as
1997.76 1999.76	pests why do you care so much about
1999.76 2001.52	insects
2001.52 2004.48	invertebrates are very unique they play
2004.48 2006.24	a part in almost every ecological
2006.24 2006.88	process
2006.88 2010.00	out there we need them more than they
2010.00 2011.28	need us
2011.28 2012.56	insects are responsible for
2012.56 2014.80	approximately 80 of the pollination out
2014.80 2015.68	there
2015.68 2017.52	pollination is needed for crops and that
2017.52 2020.51	gives us food security
2020.51 2021.60	[Music]
2021.60 2023.20	pollinators are responsible for
2023.20 2025.04	fertilizing 35
2025.04 2027.92	of the food crops we consume without
2027.92 2028.32	them
2028.32 2030.64	most plants can't disperse their pollen
2030.64 2032.48	and butterflies are among some of the
2032.48 2032.88	most
2032.88 2035.36	important pollinators we are going to
2035.36 2036.40	collect some butterflies i'm going to
2036.40 2038.00	show you how it's done
2038.00 2040.80	so we gently grab them and hold them by
2040.80 2042.32	the wings and then we drop them into the
2042.32 2044.84	basket over here
2044.84 2047.20	okay oh this thing just sprayed
2047.20 2048.40	something on me
2048.40 2050.32	yeah it's a defense mechanism it
2050.32 2052.88	excretes some liquid
2052.88 2054.64	what was that like uh don't worry it's
2054.64 2056.48	nothing it's just a normal excretion
2056.48 2058.64	that is quite common after they have
2058.64 2059.92	must be something gross right that's why
2059.92 2062.56	you're not telling me
2062.56 2065.84	we're gonna be releasing them into the
2065.84 2067.88	[Music]
2067.88 2072.84	[Applause]
2072.84 2074.56	aviary
2074.56 2077.12	most of the time we tend to undermine
2077.12 2077.92	the roles
2077.92 2081.12	of insects in our ecosystem but
2081.12 2082.88	we have discovered approximately a
2082.88 2084.40	million species
2084.40 2086.48	at the same time scientists also predict
2086.48 2088.00	there's so many more out
2088.00 2091.28	there that we still have yet to discover
2091.28 2092.88	having not discovered them we don't
2092.88 2094.32	exactly understand the total
2094.32 2096.48	impact how much are we benefiting from
2096.48 2098.08	them
2098.08 2099.28	okay so we're gonna release the
2099.28 2101.28	butterflies now and you can do the
2101.28 2102.16	honest really
2102.16 2105.54	yes oh wow
2105.54 2107.60	[Music]
2107.60 2109.44	scientists believe that there could be
2109.44 2111.68	almost 7 million species
2111.68 2114.80	still waiting to be found
2114.80 2117.84	globally about 18 000 are discovered
2117.84 2119.27	every year
2119.27 2121.68	[Music]
2121.68 2124.48	and recently some scientists suspect
2124.48 2126.88	that one creature found in our forests
2126.88 2129.28	could be a new species of a worm that's
2129.28 2130.08	older than
2130.08 2132.27	the dinosaurs
2132.27 2133.68	[Music]
2133.68 2135.92	yeah so this worm is at least 500
2135.92 2137.04	million years old
2137.04 2139.20	wow but you can find them in in the
2139.20 2146.56	forest in singapore
2146.56 2149.60	profile and his team are interested
2149.60 2153.52	in its excrement wow that's a lot of
2153.52 2155.60	slime
2155.60 2158.66	if you missed that here it is again
2158.66 2162.32	[Applause]
2162.32 2163.60	yeah you see you can see how my finger
2163.60 2165.60	is just sticking to that like that yeah
2165.60 2168.72	that's exactly the function of it
2168.72 2170.88	the slime hardens quickly but what's
2170.88 2172.88	unique is that it can dissolve in water
2172.88 2174.32	over time
2174.32 2176.08	profili and his team are trying to
2176.08 2178.08	identify the chemical properties
2178.08 2181.20	that make this possible
2181.20 2183.68	and once they unlock this mystery they
2183.68 2185.44	can synthetically create a similar
2185.44 2186.00	material
2186.00 2189.84	that could hopefully replace plastic
2189.84 2191.84	you could dump it in the ocean and it
2191.84 2194.72	would degrade into amino acids that any
2194.72 2197.60	living creature could recycle so then as
2197.60 2199.36	a scientist would you say that you
2199.36 2201.76	constantly look to nature as kind of
2201.76 2203.92	this treasure trove of solutions
2203.92 2206.64	uh yes in all nature there's many many
2206.64 2208.00	solutions have been solved
2208.00 2210.00	over millions of years of evolution for
2210.00 2211.28	a specific problem
2211.28 2213.28	that's the case for many other organisms
2213.28 2215.36	on the planet including here
2215.36 2217.04	there's many things you can learn from
2217.04 2219.12	many many different living creatures
2219.12 2220.88	[Music]
2220.88 2222.88	the team is also studying a shrimp that
2222.88 2226.84	can punch hundreds of times above its
2226.84 2230.00	weight
2230.00 2233.12	oh here we go started attacking me
2233.12 2236.64	[Music]
2236.64 2238.32	well actually you took it it just
2238.32 2241.60	knocked it right out of my tweezers
2241.60 2243.60	some mantis shrimp species have two
2243.60 2245.76	hammer-like clubs
2245.76 2248.24	see those they allow the mantis shrimp
2248.24 2249.92	to strike their prey with the force of a
2249.92 2250.56	bullet
2250.56 2254.40	without any damage to itself
2254.40 2256.00	and so we're looking at the material
2256.00 2257.60	that is made of
2257.60 2259.36	any material that has to be impact
2259.36 2261.76	resistant like bulletproof vessel
2261.76 2264.96	for instance or uh maybe new kind of
2264.96 2267.76	light lightweight uh helmet you know
2267.76 2268.72	this kind of uh
2268.72 2272.72	of a structure could be potentially you
2272.72 2275.28	every organism has some secret to tell
2275.28 2275.84	us
2275.84 2278.96	the biodiversity the the more you you
2278.96 2280.72	discover the more you look at it the
2280.72 2282.32	more chance you have to discover
2282.32 2286.56	something which is completely unexpected
2286.56 2288.80	for centuries we've looked to nature for
2288.80 2289.76	answers
2289.76 2292.32	leonardo da vinci conceived the idea of
2292.32 2293.28	human flight
2293.28 2296.72	by studying birds
2296.72 2298.64	the bullet train's design was inspired
2298.64 2302.32	by the kingfisher's beak
2302.32 2304.00	and more than a hundred medical drugs
2304.00 2305.68	are derived from compounds
2305.68 2316.00	found in plants
2316.00 2318.00	but recent science has also uncovered
2318.00 2319.68	that nature doesn't just
2319.68 2322.56	heal our bodies you maybe begin to close
2322.56 2324.16	your eyes
2324.16 2328.64	but also our souls i just felt like
2328.64 2333.82	you know this very profound sense of
2333.82 2338.84	[Music]
2338.84 2345.92	rediscovery
2345.92 2347.60	i've discovered that nature holds the
2347.60 2349.04	secrets to modern day
2349.04 2352.64	problems well actually it took it
2352.64 2354.32	this slime is basically a natural
2354.32 2356.96	bioplastic
2356.96 2359.12	but recent science has also uncovered
2359.12 2361.36	that nature can have healing powers
2361.36 2364.40	on our mind and body
2364.40 2366.80	i want to put that to the test so i
2366.80 2369.36	signed up for a forest bathing session
2369.36 2371.36	one of the latest wellness trends in
2371.36 2375.04	singapore
2375.04 2376.48	you know never in a million years would
2376.48 2377.68	i have thought of walking through a
2377.68 2378.80	housing estate
2378.80 2380.72	under some mrt tracks and then finding
2380.72 2384.96	myself in this green oasis
2384.96 2386.96	earlier on this is also a plot human is
2386.96 2388.24	my guide
2388.24 2390.88	she is just one of seven certified
2390.88 2392.32	forest therapy guides
2392.32 2396.80	in singapore hello nice to see you again
2396.80 2399.12	okay so um this is a mat for you thank
2399.12 2400.00	you
2400.00 2402.56	is everyone comfortable yeah it's kind
2402.56 2403.92	of yes yeah
2403.92 2405.84	can we take off our shoes you can if you
2405.84 2408.08	want to so this invitation is called
2408.08 2409.68	pleasures of presence
2409.68 2412.72	finding pleasure as you become present
2412.72 2413.92	then when you're ready when you're
2413.92 2416.80	settled you feel that you have found a
2416.80 2420.56	comfortable place to look at
2420.56 2422.84	and then you maybe begin to close your
2422.84 2425.20	eyes
2425.20 2438.24	not available
2438.24 2440.00	a compound that protects them from
2440.00 2441.92	disease and bacteria
2441.92 2444.88	and inhaling them can boost our immunity
2444.88 2447.36	and reduce stress
2447.36 2450.64	so taking your time slowly rising with
2450.64 2452.80	your eyes closed
2452.80 2455.52	just allow your vision to come in a soft
2455.52 2456.40	focus
2456.40 2457.46	take our time
2457.46 2461.12	[Music]
2461.12 2464.56	and then notice this whole space
2464.56 2467.52	that you are in by your sense of sight
2467.52 2470.24	what are you noticing
2470.24 2471.76	when we were doing that rotational thing
2471.76 2473.44	i just felt like
2473.44 2477.60	you know this very profound sense of
2477.60 2481.20	rediscovery i just really thought of
2481.20 2482.72	you know that moment when you're a fetus
2482.72 2484.00	and you're coming out of your of your
2484.00 2485.36	mom's womb and
2485.36 2486.72	and really opening your eyes for the
2486.72 2487.92	first time and i just can't imagine how
2487.92 2488.48	that must
2488.48 2491.92	feel i felt for the fetus that i was
2491.92 2495.60	several decades ago wishing that
2495.60 2498.00	hoping that my birth was as peaceful as
2498.00 2499.20	what i just experienced
2499.20 2500.64	[Music]
2500.64 2502.96	i can't believe it i just waxed lyrical
2502.96 2504.48	about my birth
2504.48 2506.40	these phyton sites are clearly doing
2506.40 2509.36	something to my head
2509.36 2512.64	next up a slow wonder
2512.64 2516.16	through the forest
2516.16 2520.40	i get what this is now it is a moving
2520.40 2523.92	experiential meditation session
2523.92 2527.20	followed by 10 minutes of water gazing
2527.20 2530.08	literally i feel like i'm in japan right
2530.08 2532.16	now
2532.16 2534.88	and finally a tea ceremony to end the
2534.88 2539.44	session
2539.44 2540.96	so so far the people i've been speaking
2540.96 2542.72	to have been trying to educate me about
2542.72 2545.44	nature in very scientific ways
2545.44 2548.80	now having experienced nature in a very
2548.80 2551.04	physical manner has made it a whole lot
2551.04 2552.93	more personal
2552.93 2556.48	[Music]
2556.48 2558.96	so naturally i've jumped at the next
2558.96 2561.36	chance to get back into the wilderness
2561.36 2563.52	but this time to see the rescued
2563.52 2566.24	pangolin i saw just days ago
2566.24 2568.88	after being treated at the zoo it's
2568.88 2570.48	being picked up by anne parks
2570.48 2578.16	for its release back into the wild
2578.16 2580.56	so i can't reveal my location but what i
2580.56 2582.16	can tell you is that we are somewhere
2582.16 2584.88	deep in the jungle
2584.88 2587.28	so when deciding on a site to release it
2587.28 2588.96	what are the factors you consider
2588.96 2590.72	we have to consider whether there's
2590.72 2592.56	sufficient food whether there's
2592.56 2595.52	some shelter and most importantly away
2595.52 2596.64	from the roads
2596.64 2598.48	we also see how many that we release our
2598.48 2601.36	males here i said how many females
2601.36 2603.68	you cannot have a bachelor group here
2603.68 2604.72	right right so
2604.72 2607.04	we all have to be taking a lot into
2607.04 2609.76	consideration
2609.76 2613.44	it's very quiet so most likely
2613.44 2617.44	we need some coaxing so but let's try
2617.44 2619.92	pangolins typically produce only one or
2619.92 2620.96	two offspring
2620.96 2623.68	every year and they're notoriously hard
2623.68 2625.60	to breed in captivity
2625.60 2627.68	so it's crucial to create the best
2627.68 2629.20	chances for this spatula
2629.20 2635.44	to sow his seeds in the wild
2635.44 2637.44	so it's just curled up into a ball right
2637.44 2638.72	now um
2638.72 2641.20	it is very frightened and very scared so
2641.20 2642.80	the ant parks officers are just trying
2642.80 2643.12	to
2643.12 2646.08	coax it into into being less afraid i
2646.08 2647.28	suppose
2647.28 2648.88	what what do you want for it that we
2648.88 2650.72	find a partner and repopulate it
2650.72 2655.44	yeah yes yes he's speeding up
2655.44 2658.88	he's sleeping that's some heavy
2658.88 2660.32	expectations
2660.32 2663.12	but the survival of his species depends
2663.12 2665.84	on it
2665.84 2669.36	well i hope he gets it on soon
2669.36 2671.04	[Music]
2671.04 2673.60	but if anything recent history has shown
2673.60 2676.08	us that locally extinct wildlife
2676.08 2679.12	can return
2679.12 2682.00	it's a tale embodied by one particular
2682.00 2683.20	species
2683.20 2685.44	that's one of bernard's favorite
2685.44 2688.84	subjects
2688.84 2692.56	look
2692.56 2696.24	there they are there they are hello
2696.24 2699.36	hey there's so many of them we have two
2699.36 2701.36	species of otters in singapore
2701.36 2704.48	the smooth coated otter
2704.48 2707.12	and its more elusive cousin the asian
2707.12 2708.40	small clawed otter
2708.40 2711.60	that's found only on pulau ubin
2711.60 2713.84	watching them i find it hard to believe
2713.84 2717.28	that they were once extinct locally
2717.28 2719.52	they disappeared in the 1960s when our
2719.52 2721.68	rivers became so heavily polluted
2721.68 2725.20	that no marine life could survive
2725.20 2726.96	they probably went down the coast and
2726.96 2728.24	went to malaysia
2728.24 2730.00	and why did they return what did we do
2730.00 2731.52	differently what happened was when we
2731.52 2732.72	cleaned up our waterways
2732.72 2735.68	they were spotted again in the late 90s
2735.68 2737.76	so the authors are a success story right
2737.76 2739.04	does this mean that we could actually
2739.04 2740.88	attract more species back to singapore
2740.88 2741.84	if we do more
2741.84 2744.64	so our smooth quoted orders are very
2744.64 2747.04	urban and adaptive species
2747.04 2749.04	but not all animals that we find in
2749.04 2750.08	singapore
2750.08 2753.20	are this adaptive singapore mainland
2753.20 2756.40	doesn't have ideal habitats for example
2756.40 2759.36	for the asian small clock to thrive they
2759.36 2761.04	need shallower waters they need a
2761.04 2763.68	mangrove habitat they need extruding
2763.68 2766.80	habitats so it's important that we
2766.80 2770.48	preserve some existing
2770.48 2778.72	forests mangrove areas
2778.72 2781.76	in the next episode when a forest is
2781.76 2782.72	fragmented
2782.72 2784.88	they start to unravel they start to lose
2784.88 2786.72	diversity they start to
2786.72 2789.52	become very disturbed the race to save
2789.52 2791.20	our wildlife from extinction
2791.20 2793.76	has already begun we are talking about
2793.76 2794.48	species
2794.48 2796.48	which are under threat because we know
2796.48 2798.96	so little about them
2798.96 2801.36	i find out what it takes oh my goodness
2801.36 2802.88	it's so soft
2802.88 2804.80	never in my life would i have imagined
2804.80 2806.32	getting so excited about picking up
2806.32 2809.12	someone else's
2809.12 2811.44	and whether it's too late to turn back
2811.44 2812.24	the clock
2812.24 2814.48	one thing particularly worrying is that
2814.48 2817.83	we're getting rare threatened species as
2817.83 2821.80	[Music]
2821.80 2824.80	roadkill
