2.64 3.28	hospital
3.28 6.32	is under lockdown contoxing hospital has
6.32 8.56	been at the front line since corvette 19
8.56 10.72	hit singapore's shores
10.72 12.96	now it is at the center of an outbreak
12.96 16.00	with 13 linked cases of covet 19 and
16.00 18.96	more expected to be confirmed
18.96 20.64	we are monitoring this particular
20.64 22.48	cluster at dundoxin hospital very
22.48 23.44	closely
23.44 26.16	the next few days will be critical we
26.16 27.76	find many more cases
27.76 30.88	that suggest widespread transmission we
30.88 32.24	will have to introduce
32.24 34.24	more measures to break the chain of
34.24 36.16	transmission
36.16 40.00	as of april 30th the 13 covet 19 cases
40.00 42.00	comprised eight patients
42.00 45.04	two doctors a nurse a cleaner and a
45.04 47.52	healthcare assistant
47.52 49.52	here's a timeline of how the cluster
49.52 50.88	unfolded
50.88 53.04	one patient had developed symptoms as
53.04 55.60	early as april 16th but only sought
55.60 58.00	medical treatment two days later
58.00 60.72	he was subsequently put into ward 70
60.72 63.76	after testing negative for covet 19.
63.76 66.64	on april 20th he was transferred to ward
66.64 68.08	9d
68.08 70.56	another patient in ward 90 developed
70.56 72.64	symptoms on sunday
72.64 74.64	a nurse deployed to the ward developed a
74.64 76.08	cough sore throat
76.08 78.72	and body aches on tuesday and tested
78.72 82.08	positive for covet 19 on the same day
82.08 85.28	after her infection was confirmed ttsh
85.28 87.36	locked down the affected ward and tested
87.36 89.52	patients and staff members who had been
89.52 91.36	there
91.36 93.76	two more staff members and six patients
93.76 97.20	in ward 90 tested positive for covet 19.
97.20 100.80	the cluster was announced on april 29th
100.80 102.48	four more cases are linked to the
102.48 104.24	cluster at ttsh
104.24 108.96	bringing the total to 13 cases
108.96 111.04	now the hospital is under strict
111.04 112.32	lockdown
112.32 114.72	we are not allowing visitors into our
114.72 115.36	wards
115.36 118.80	till further notice for those who are
118.80 120.80	for those patients who are critically
120.80 123.60	ill we will allow visitors
123.60 126.64	by exception on a compassionate basis
126.64 128.72	new precautions have been implemented at
128.72 130.56	ttsh
130.56 132.84	along with the limits on visitors
132.84 134.24	non-life-threatening a
134.24 136.48	e cases will be redirected to other
136.48 137.92	hospitals
137.92 140.08	temperature taking and hygiene measures
140.08 141.36	have been stepped up
141.36 143.68	and for those working in the hospital
143.68 145.44	all 1100
145.44 148.56	inpatients and 4 500 staff will be
148.56 149.92	swapped
149.92 152.32	76 staff who are close contacts have
152.32 154.64	been placed on leave of absence awaiting
154.64 156.08	quarantine orders
156.08 158.24	with hundreds more expected to do so in
158.24 160.16	the coming days
160.16 162.32	and as the saying goes prevention is
162.32 163.92	better than cure
163.92 166.08	authorities are taking no chances to
166.08 168.16	ensure that the outbreak does not spread
168.16 170.24	to other hospitals we
170.24 174.08	remain vigilant and to
174.08 175.52	look to see whether or not there's any
175.52 177.04	possibility that there'll be other cases
177.04 178.88	that go to any of our other hospitals
178.88 181.44	all our hospitals have been instructed
181.44 182.72	to
182.72 184.80	to check on their processes to make sure
184.80 185.92	that they are
185.92 188.24	vigilant disciplined and strict with
188.24 189.60	infection control
189.60 191.60	within the hospitals and and that we are
191.60 193.76	monitoring the situation very closely
193.76 197.28	we have not engaged all the measures
197.28 198.64	that we could have done
198.64 202.08	uh with uh but we've decided that we
202.08 203.52	will
203.52 206.88	impose or implement a more stricter
206.88 208.08	measures in time toxin
208.08 210.08	simply because this is where the current
210.08 211.36	outbreak is
211.36 213.68	and we will monitor this on a day-to-day
213.68 215.76	basis while the emergence of both
215.76 217.60	this cluster and one linked to an
217.60 218.80	immigration officer
218.80 221.36	raises the number of community cases
221.36 223.52	authorities are confident that singapore
223.52 225.52	can overcome this bump in the road on
225.52 226.08	its long
226.08 228.88	journey back to normalcy this is the
228.88 229.44	first time
229.44 232.88	in quite some time that we have seen
232.88 235.76	relatively larger clusters emerging in
235.76 237.04	the community
237.04 240.24	so obviously it is cause for concern but
240.24 240.72	we have
240.72 243.04	and we have also learned from experience
243.04 245.28	that in order to
245.28 247.52	control and break the transmission
247.52 248.80	chains we must
248.80 252.00	move in quickly um to try
252.00 255.04	and you know stop the transmission from
255.04 257.60	spreading further
257.60 260.64	we now have better tools to do this we
260.64 262.64	have testing capabilities we have a
262.64 263.52	better
263.52 266.80	tracing system used using trace together
266.80 267.36	and save
267.36 271.04	entry so we are essentially using
271.04 274.40	everything at our disposal to try and
274.40 277.52	slow the infection control keep it under
277.52 278.56	control
278.56 288.50	and break the transmission chains
