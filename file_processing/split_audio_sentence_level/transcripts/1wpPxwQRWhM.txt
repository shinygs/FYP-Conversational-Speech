8.32 10.72	last year this time
10.72 14.16	i was traveling the world investigating
14.16 17.04	food mysteries disappearing fish in
17.04 20.56	indonesia
20.56 23.84	a butter crisis in france and a menacing
23.84 26.32	pest in thailand
26.32 31.52	now the only traveling i do is this
31.52 34.40	food deliveries this is worse than
34.40 35.36	anything i've ever seen
35.36 39.28	okay thank you my business is shut we're
39.28 41.12	screwed
41.12 43.92	kovit 19 is the most disruptive force
43.92 45.60	the global food industry has
45.60 48.64	ever seen the whole supply chain is
48.64 50.48	disrupted
50.48 52.40	in the u.s quite a number of the
52.40 54.88	factories had to close because of kovit
54.88 60.48	so it's a major 30 drop
60.48 63.68	from farm to table it is a wake-up call
63.68 80.60	for all of us in this business
80.60 84.32	2020 while a lot of industries took a
84.32 84.64	hit
84.64 88.72	because of covet 19 one business was in
88.72 92.64	overdrive
92.64 96.16	especially between april to july
96.16 99.20	at its peak we bought 74 percent
99.20 101.52	more at our supermarkets as compared to
101.52 102.72	the same period
102.72 106.00	last year to keep up with demand
106.00 107.12	supermarkets
107.12 109.84	imposed purchase limits they restocked
109.84 111.28	their shelves more often
111.28 114.16	and they hired thousands more but it
114.16 114.56	turned
114.56 116.64	the grocery shopping experience during
116.64 117.84	that period
117.84 121.44	into quite a challenge
121.44 123.92	in this episode i want to find out if we
123.92 124.88	should rethink
124.88 128.24	where we shop for our food and if we are
128.24 129.36	over reliant
129.36 133.31	on our supermarkets
133.31 134.96	[Music]
134.96 137.68	this is what grocery shopping used to
137.68 138.27	look like
138.27 140.84	[Music]
140.84 148.40	hello
148.40 150.88	it was largely personalized and over the
150.88 152.64	counter
152.64 159.20	they have the french
159.20 162.00	but all this changed with the arrival of
162.00 164.56	the supermarket
164.56 167.76	for the first time there were aisles to
167.76 170.08	walk along and a wide range of products
170.08 171.84	to choose from
171.84 174.00	but supermarkets didn't just bring us
174.00 176.56	new experiences and varieties
176.56 179.68	they also helped us through crises
179.68 181.76	fair price for example was set up during
181.76 184.80	the 1973 oil crisis
184.80 190.88	to keep our food items reasonably priced
190.88 194.16	this crisis was no different at the
194.16 196.40	height of the pandemic we've rushed to
196.40 198.00	our supermarkets to stock up on
198.00 201.36	our essentials
201.36 204.40	but in spite of their best efforts
204.40 206.24	shelves were still emptying faster than
206.24 209.84	they could be restocked
209.84 212.00	which is why food security expert dr
212.00 214.24	cecilia believes that pandemic has made
214.24 215.12	it clear
215.12 216.88	that we need to rethink how we
216.88 220.56	distribute our essentials
220.56 222.40	do you think we should reduce our
222.40 224.08	reliance on supermarkets
224.08 226.96	yes we need more options and we need
226.96 228.24	that people know that there are more
228.24 228.96	options
228.96 231.36	options decentralization options that
231.36 232.72	they don't need to use public
232.72 235.28	transportation or drive their car
235.28 237.84	places that are close to them if one
237.84 238.32	person
238.32 240.32	had been sick everybody would have got
240.32 242.16	to see we need to spread this out not to
242.16 243.76	have high density of population in the
243.76 244.40	same place
244.40 251.84	for health for security and for options
251.84 253.52	if i were to ask you to describe the
253.52 254.88	supermarket experience
254.88 258.00	what would you say
258.00 259.12	do you do you like coming to a
259.12 262.08	supermarket yes there's a lot of variety
262.08 264.24	because it's aircon okay and then it's
264.24 265.44	big and spacious
265.44 273.84	okay
273.84 275.60	what's your favorite part of the entire
275.60 277.84	supermarket looking at the fish
277.84 280.24	looking at the fish i would say that as
280.24 281.20	a young kid
281.20 282.96	one of my favorite places to go to was
282.96 284.64	the supermarket and it still
284.64 288.08	is i'm mesmerized by the wide variety of
288.08 288.88	products
288.88 291.20	the food ingredients and just looking
291.20 293.84	and smelling and touching and seeing
293.84 296.24	all these lovely things all these edible
296.24 298.71	things it's just such a joy
298.71 300.80	[Music]
300.80 303.68	you see the thing is a lot of what we do
303.68 304.80	in supermarkets is
304.80 308.08	by design as professor monster is about
308.08 309.20	to show me
309.20 311.44	the supermarkets use their design
311.44 313.76	assortment all the decisions are made
313.76 315.84	to basically encourage people whether
315.84 317.52	consciously unconsciously to
317.52 319.44	buy stuff buy more stuff and sometimes
319.44 323.28	even buy more expensive stuff
323.28 325.28	professor mansur has brought in two
325.28 339.44	shoppers to prove his point
339.44 342.88	hello lady was anything that you
342.88 345.12	kind of may not have initially planned
345.12 346.00	to buy and
346.00 348.56	you ended up putting your card i bought
348.56 350.88	soya waiting over there
350.88 353.92	so they exist the sneaky uh oh since
353.92 355.20	you're waiting you might as well put it
355.20 355.68	in right
355.68 357.76	i was shopping for a cracker a packet of
357.76 359.20	crackers and the lady was telling me why
359.20 360.56	didn't you get three it's cheaper so
360.56 361.20	it's like
361.20 363.12	okay it's really much cheaper why not so
363.12 367.68	i bought three instead of one
367.68 368.96	and you also had some stuff that you
368.96 370.80	didn't expect to buy yeah i
370.80 374.00	i don't usually buy what else
374.00 376.08	intelligence interpretation yeah there
376.08 378.84	you go psychology of supermarket
378.84 381.52	shopping
381.52 384.08	from the time you guys moved off to
384.08 385.36	begin shopping
385.36 387.36	so the time that you stopped here you
387.36 395.04	guys took approximately 40 minutes
395.04 398.08	this is not my usual supermarket so a
398.08 398.64	lot of it
398.64 401.36	is not in the right places you know like
401.36 403.60	why is rice there and then bread on that
403.60 404.08	side
404.08 411.36	did that slow you down it did because
411.36 413.44	retailers right they want to encourage
413.44 415.60	you to spend more time in store
415.60 417.84	so one way to go about it is to
417.84 419.84	occasionally switch things up a bit even
419.84 421.52	just a little bit so that
421.52 423.28	it disrupts your regular routine and
423.28 424.80	that way the hope is that
424.80 426.80	perhaps you would spend a bit more time
426.80 428.64	you would linger around and maybe
428.64 431.12	as you do that you perhaps may end up
431.12 433.36	considering additional items or maybe
433.36 435.84	doing something differently buying more
435.84 439.92	stuff that's very clever
439.92 442.00	supermarkets are designed to make you
442.00 442.96	linger and
442.96 446.40	browse so the question here how big is a
446.40 450.32	coronavirus risk in our supermarkets
450.32 452.88	the world health organization says it is
452.88 454.24	highly unlikely
454.24 456.56	that people can contract covet 19 from
456.56 457.44	food or
457.44 460.16	food packaging so there's no real need
460.16 463.28	to sanitize that apple you just bought
463.28 465.68	the highest risk is if you're in close
465.68 468.40	contact with other people
468.40 470.72	next would be surfaces that are commonly
470.72 471.60	touched
471.60 475.20	and there are plenty around someone who
475.20 476.24	didn't practice
476.24 479.04	good hand hygiene might have touched
479.04 483.52	these surfaces
483.52 486.24	studies have also found that covet 19
486.24 488.40	particles can linger in the air
488.40 491.20	in crowded or poorly ventilated indoor
491.20 492.80	spaces
492.80 496.32	and can survive longer in colder
496.32 500.16	and drier air
500.16 501.68	the thing is we're still in a pandemic
501.68 503.92	situation and lingering indoors in
503.92 505.60	air-conditioned spaces might not be the
505.60 510.32	safest option
510.32 512.80	to be fair our supermarkets have tried
512.80 514.96	to find ways to reduce traffic in their
514.96 516.56	stores
516.56 518.64	cold storage and giant launched click
518.64 520.88	and collect a service that allows
520.88 522.72	customers to order online
522.72 525.60	for pickup at the store whilst
525.60 527.60	singapore's largest supermarket chain
527.60 528.40	fair price
528.40 531.52	ramped up their online deliveries
531.52 533.12	visit to actually our online website
533.12 535.60	search between four to five times
535.60 538.40	four to five times see we have also
538.40 539.20	increased our
539.20 542.24	capacity by around 25 percent to cater
542.24 543.36	to online business
543.36 544.80	we also converted one of our great
544.80 546.64	mother stores into fulfillment centers
546.64 548.16	for online orders
548.16 549.76	and that's actually a further increase
549.76 551.76	of capacity to more than 50
551.76 555.04	of it but what did it take for fair
555.04 557.20	price to ramp up capacity to meet
557.20 560.72	our grocery needs well jonathan has
560.72 562.24	arranged for me to meet

704.40 708.24	hour to pick up just four items
708.24 711.28	if this was an interview i'm pretty sure
711.28 713.76	i just lost the job
713.76 715.68	and i'm beginning to see why ramping up
715.68 717.04	online capacity
717.04 720.56	is easier said than done i'll be honest
720.56 720.96	it's a
720.96 722.48	fairly tiring process and you feel like
722.48 723.28	you're on the clock you're running
723.28 724.64	around finding things
724.64 728.32	this is quite a laborious process yes
728.32 730.40	since the beginning of the year fair
730.40 732.00	price has increased their online
732.00 733.36	capacity by more than
733.36 737.28	50 but even by dedicating an entire
737.28 739.76	store to fulfilling online orders
739.76 742.80	and hiring more pickers fair price still
742.80 745.04	struggled to meet the surge in online
745.04 754.16	demand
754.16 756.88	about supermarkets whether online or
756.88 759.20	brick-and-mortar aren't the only places
759.20 759.76	to buy
759.76 763.60	our groceries we're a foodie nation
763.60 765.84	there is no lack of places to buy our
765.84 767.36	essentials
767.36 769.20	could we have relied more on other
769.20 771.60	places at the height of the pandemic
771.60 787.34	is it time to relook the way we shop
787.34 794.48	[Music]
794.48 797.52	supermarkets they change the way we shop
797.52 804.16	they pioneer the concept of self-service
804.16 806.24	and inspire the creation of the shopping
806.24 807.60	cart
807.60 810.08	they also expanded our pallets with a
810.08 815.20	wide variety of food items
815.20 818.24	and in just a few decades the number of
818.24 819.52	supermarkets have
819.52 823.84	multiplied grown in size
823.84 829.68	range and sales volume
829.68 832.08	today we have more than 500 supermarkets
832.08 834.40	and together they dominate our grocery
834.40 835.28	sales
835.28 837.28	the pandemic has shown that in a time of
837.28 839.76	crisis it's simply unsustainable to
839.76 841.60	centralize all our purchasing
841.60 844.72	in one place now the circuit breaker is
844.72 845.76	temporary
845.76 848.80	not a way of life and while life in our
848.80 850.80	supermarkets has pretty much gone back
850.80 851.92	to normal
851.92 854.48	kovit 19 has revealed it may not be a
854.48 856.56	bad idea to diversify
856.56 861.84	where we get our groceries
861.84 864.48	culinary anthropologist nithia does the
864.48 866.56	most of her grocery shopping at our wet
866.56 868.80	markets
868.80 874.48	one of her favorites is gaelang sarai
874.48 876.56	what do you think wet markets like these
876.56 878.56	offer versus supermarkets
878.56 880.80	i think you're definitely uh it's quite
880.80 882.72	hard to respect that one meter safe
882.72 883.92	distancing role
883.92 885.76	in supermarkets you definitely have a
885.76 887.76	lot more space in wet markets they are
887.76 889.20	tiny alleyways
889.20 891.68	but it's it's easy to space yourself out
891.68 893.20	if one shop is very crowded
893.20 895.04	go to another shop to another shop yeah
895.04 896.72	so i think that's the option that web
896.72 898.16	markets give you
898.16 900.88	that flexibility the community the
900.88 901.76	choice
901.76 903.12	that's kind of why i would choose wet
903.12 904.80	markets always
904.80 906.64	so what do you think this pandemic that
906.64 908.32	we're in right now has
908.32 911.36	exposed about the way people shop
911.36 913.36	i think what we're really realizing with
913.36 914.72	crisis
914.72 916.80	is as consumers we really have to
916.80 918.00	decentralize
918.00 919.60	the way we shop instead of going to the
919.60 922.00	supermarkets go to your provision shops
922.00 924.32	go to your mama shops you know go to
924.32 925.44	your web markets
925.44 927.28	i mean in my lifetime i've already seen
927.28 928.64	the number of web markets we have has
928.64 929.36	shrunk
929.36 931.68	the size of them is much much smaller
931.68 932.88	than they used to be
932.88 934.80	so when i speak to people of my
934.80 936.64	generation or younger
936.64 938.80	you know who are used more to shopping
938.80 940.48	in a supermarket and i asked them what
940.48 942.00	prevents them from feeling very
942.00 943.68	comfortable in a wet market
943.68 945.84	it's very basic things it's it's kind of
945.84 947.04	receipts
947.04 949.60	you know being able to have a telephoto
949.60 950.80	of things
950.80 953.44	is how things are packaged as well and
953.44 955.04	also i think it's the appearance of
955.04 955.84	hygiene
955.84 960.08	okay the perception of cleanliness
960.08 962.64	what do you think white markets should
962.64 964.56	do to keep themselves more relevant as
964.56 965.24	these
965.24 968.48	decentralized locations smaller hubs of
968.48 969.44	people to shop in
969.44 972.08	so maybe cashless payments bring that in
972.08 972.72	you know like
972.72 974.40	you look at places like china and stuff
974.40 976.56	even your street stores you can just pay
976.56 980.40	via your phone cashless payments
980.40 982.64	i go to supermarkets more than i go to
982.64 983.60	wet markets
983.60 985.44	simply because of the convenience they
985.44 987.28	offer and i am not
987.28 992.00	alone a 2019 nea survey found that 39
992.00 994.32	of respondents hadn't visited a wet
994.32 995.52	market in the past
995.52 998.72	year that's nearly double the number in
998.72 1001.12	2014.
1001.12 1004.08	thank you very much thank you thank you
1004.08 1005.84	can you imagine if we didn't have our
1005.84 1007.52	white markets during the circuit breaker
1007.52 1009.04	period
1009.04 1010.80	and that may well be the case in the
1010.80 1012.24	next pandemic if
1012.24 1015.12	we continue to overlook our web markets
1015.12 1016.48	what is it going to take to keep them
1016.48 1018.80	around
1018.80 1021.84	since covet 19 some savvier stall owners
1021.84 1023.52	have been moving their business
1023.52 1027.49	from the wet market to the web market
1027.49 1028.72	[Music]
1028.72 1030.72	they joined a growing number of live
1030.72 1032.08	streaming shops
1032.08 1033.92	that have been popping up on facebook
1033.92 1052.56	over the past two years
1052.56 1055.76	its fastest fingers first
1055.76 1057.44	orders are made through the comments
1057.44 1060.00	section and once the bid is successful
1060.00 1061.44	and payment is made
1061.44 1064.96	the items get delivered
1064.96 1068.24	very very nice okay
1068.24 1071.12	so this guy's videos get up to 70 000

1071.84 1074.24	that's quite a lot of eyeballs it's got
1074.24 1075.04	me thinking right
1075.04 1077.68	could facebook live be a way for white
1077.68 1081.68	markets to stay relevant
1081.68 1085.04	every day thousands visit fishmonger max

1222.64 1230.00	people are responding to his energy
1230.00 1231.12	so as you're sending things then you're
1231.12 1232.40	telling them other people asking
1232.40 1233.84	questions in here responding and then
1233.84 1235.04	they're looking at the item
1235.04 1236.36	and it's very visceral it's very
1236.36 1243.55	realistic
1243.55 1245.04	[Applause]
1245.04 1312.44	okay so it's like
1312.44 1316.08	[Music]
1316.08 1318.72	when circuit breaker hit some stall
1318.72 1320.56	holders attacker market had the first
1320.56 1321.60	taste of going
1321.60 1325.04	live okay
1325.04 1327.04	so guys i have australian carrots
1327.04 1328.16	cauliflower
1328.16 1331.20	tomatoes the two-day imda initiative
1331.20 1333.20	featured a series of live streaming
1333.20 1334.64	sessions
1334.64 1336.64	customers could order and receive fresh
1336.64 1338.80	produce without even setting foot in the
1338.80 1340.16	market
1340.16 1342.56	now the first one hit more than 20 000
1342.56 1345.20	views and sold out within an hour is the
1345.20 1352.96	watermelon
1352.96 1355.76	it's been six months since the launch
1355.76 1358.84	and i wonder if they're keeping it
1358.84 1361.84	up
1361.84 1363.60	it's a actually a very good thing
1363.60 1366.32	unfortunately i do not have the time to
1366.32 1370.24	manage it um i'm not very
1370.24 1371.92	good with tech also now you've stopped
1371.92 1377.08	livestreaming i stopped
1377.08 1392.74	[Music]
1392.74 1404.24	[Music]
1404.24 1414.29	[Music]
1414.29 1428.96	[Music]
1428.96 1430.40	i suppose that once in a while there's
1430.40 1433.84	no point during either
1433.84 1456.84	just one stall remains
1456.84 1459.83	huh
1459.83 1463.25	[Applause]
1463.25 1471.75	[Music]
1471.75 1479.83	[Music]
1479.83 1484.84	[Music]
1484.84 1486.32	m
1486.32 1487.92	so out of the six stall holders that
1487.92 1489.92	were listed in the tekka online
1489.92 1492.48	uh website it seems like only one has
1492.48 1494.00	carried on to do live streaming on a
1494.00 1495.04	daily basis
1495.04 1496.96	and it doesn't seem quite as useful for
1496.96 1499.12	the remainder of the store holders
1499.12 1501.20	my question is this right if when
1501.20 1502.88	markets want to continue remaining
1502.88 1503.92	relevant
1503.92 1505.60	uh to a younger crowd especially if
1505.60 1507.12	footballs are dropping to white markets
1507.12 1507.68	then
1507.68 1509.92	don't they need to figure out ways to
1509.92 1511.36	sustainably innovate
1511.36 1514.48	and really get on to this and remain
1514.48 1519.92	as relevant as possible
1519.92 1523.04	live streaming may not be for everyone
1523.04 1525.12	but one company is trying to convince
1525.12 1526.32	these stall holders
1526.32 1528.16	to give the digital transformation
1528.16 1531.04	another shot
1531.04 1534.08	online marketplace tada fresh launched
1534.08 1536.00	after the circuit breaker hit
1536.00 1538.40	they provide an online delivery service
1538.40 1540.08	for wet markets
1540.08 1541.52	so we saw a lot live streaming in web
1541.52 1543.52	markets right but as far as i know
1543.52 1546.24	not all of it like really took off right
1546.24 1546.64	how
1546.64 1548.64	is tata fresh different from that so
1548.64 1550.48	just by going on to live stream alone
1550.48 1551.92	they have to be prepared to do the
1551.92 1552.80	filming
1552.80 1555.28	do the selling do the delivery and do
1555.28 1556.88	the post sales service that's a lot of
1556.88 1557.68	work for them
1557.68 1559.84	but on target fresh market all they need
1559.84 1561.76	to do they receive their whatsapp
1561.76 1563.92	they know what the orders for them they
1563.92 1566.08	pack the orders according to the items
1566.08 1567.52	that we send them
1567.52 1570.56	morning thank you
1570.56 1572.08	the next day somebody comes along to
1572.08 1574.32	collect somebody delivers the items for
1574.32 1574.64	them
1574.64 1576.16	and somebody we have a customer service
1576.16 1577.68	team that actually
1577.68 1579.52	responds to the customer's enquiries and
1579.52 1582.00	feedback after the sales is completed
1582.00 1584.32	so you guys fill that gap and plug it
1584.32 1585.28	exactly
1585.28 1587.20	so we definitely want to help these wet
1587.20 1589.84	markets uh vendors reach a digital gap
1589.84 1591.20	can our service ideas continue to
1591.20 1593.04	survive now that the circuit breaker
1593.04 1594.56	period is over
1594.56 1596.32	even though the circuit breaker period
1596.32 1598.24	is over we still do see a
1598.24 1601.52	stream of orders coming in consistently
1601.52 1603.84	and our customers who have tried fresh
1603.84 1605.60	produce delivered directly from the wet
1605.60 1606.32	markets
1606.32 1608.08	told us that they will never shop at a
1608.08 1610.24	supermarket or even buy from an online
1610.24 1612.72	supermarket grocer ever again yeah just
1612.72 1614.64	cost is so much more value for money
1614.64 1616.64	it's actually our goal to like
1616.64 1617.76	digitalize
1617.76 1619.68	most of the web markets in singapore and
1619.68 1621.60	in fact all if we can because we do want
1621.60 1622.08	to
1622.08 1624.16	like prolong the longevity of wet
1624.16 1626.00	markets in singapore
1626.00 1627.76	[Music]
1627.76 1630.00	it took two weeks to convince the stall
1630.00 1632.64	holders attacker market
1632.64 1635.52	and now they've got 24 stalls and two
1635.52 1640.56	markets on their platform
1640.56 1643.28	next on their list the dog north wet
1643.28 1649.60	market
1649.60 1651.60	i want to find out how to get these
1651.60 1654.00	stall holders on board
1654.00 1659.12	so i'm joining tada fresh for the day
1659.12 1661.76	so our aim right is to get at least one
1661.76 1662.48	vendor from
1662.48 1664.80	each category like at least one selling
1664.80 1665.60	fruit
1665.60 1668.56	vegetables poultry pork you know so that
1668.56 1670.16	we can bring the market online
1670.16 1679.28	okay steady
1679.28 1681.84	just minutes in and i'm starting to
1681.84 1682.64	realize it's
1682.64 1684.72	no easy heat about how we can get your
1684.72 1686.16	products online
1686.16 1689.12	i think i think for now for now no not
1689.12 1690.60	if we're not ready
1690.60 1694.84	[Music]
1694.84 1705.44	for
1705.44 1707.20	okay it seems a lot of the storeholders
1707.20 1708.88	are quite resistant to coming on board
1708.88 1711.04	with us they haven't really given us a
1711.04 1712.56	great response
1712.56 1714.24	and it's a little bit frustrating i'm
1714.24 1715.68	not even sure that we're going to be
1715.68 1717.04	able to get this
1717.04 1733.44	market up and online
1733.44 1736.56	i'm with tada fresh a delivery platform
1736.56 1738.56	providing ordering and logistics
1738.56 1741.08	for wet market vendors
1741.08 1742.64	[Music]
1742.64 1744.08	i'm helping them to convince stall
1744.08 1746.88	holders at pasa 216 burdock central
1746.88 1750.80	to get on board their online portal
1750.80 1753.12	but it's been more than an hour and this
1753.12 1754.64	situation doesn't look
1754.64 1755.50	promising
1755.50 1776.96	[Music]
1776.96 1779.28	i get it it's an alien concept for
1779.28 1780.88	traditionally very analog business
1780.88 1782.72	they have close links with their
1782.72 1784.24	customers they see the same regulars
1784.24 1785.68	every day everything is very human to
1785.68 1787.44	human transactions
1787.44 1790.00	this will take some getting used to but
1790.00 1790.88	it's up to
1790.88 1792.40	up to us and this generation are
1792.40 1794.72	supposed to try and help convince
1794.72 1796.72	this generation of hawkers and and web
1796.72 1798.00	market store holders
1798.00 1799.92	uh that there are benefits to get on
1799.92 1801.20	board this sort of platform
1801.20 1802.64	all right let's go find some more maybe
1802.64 1807.04	they'll have a better reaction with
1807.04 1810.08	sell us handmade dumplings that you are
1810.08 1812.40	making right on our website
1812.40 1816.08	would that be okay with you yeah
1816.08 1819.12	finally our persistence is
1819.12 1831.58	paying off food
1831.58 1841.58	[Music]
1841.58 1849.04	[Music]
1849.04 1851.68	thank you very much anyway it's gonna
1851.68 1856.64	benefit me
1856.64 1858.96	over the course of the week the tada
1858.96 1861.04	team manages to convince six small
1861.04 1861.76	stalls
1861.76 1865.20	on board the people vendors decided to
1865.20 1868.80	work with us
1868.80 1870.88	that's almost a quarter of the market
1870.88 1873.08	that's going
1873.08 1876.84	[Music]
1876.84 1881.20	online
1881.20 1882.64	so it's been almost a month since we
1882.64 1884.24	were last at this market
1884.24 1886.80	now the page has finally gone live and
1886.80 1888.24	today we're here to pick up
1888.24 1889.76	our orders from the vendors for the very
1889.76 1896.06	first time
1896.06 1897.35	[Music]
1897.35 1904.84	[Applause]
1904.84 1908.48	okay and
1908.48 1911.12	some strawberries we'll be collecting
1911.12 1933.20	almost 30 orders from across 11 stalls
1933.20 1935.20	so how do you think this system can help
1935.20 1936.72	white market vendors
1936.72 1939.04	uh become a viable alternative during
1939.04 1940.00	this kind of period
1940.00 1941.76	so i mean i'll let the numbers do the
1941.76 1944.48	talking so in seca market alone right
1944.48 1946.88	i've seen orders go up to the hundreds
1946.88 1949.44	in a day and to the extent that we could
1949.44 1950.24	not complete
1950.24 1952.00	delivering all the orders in one cycle
1952.00 1954.00	we had to do multiple cycles
1954.00 1956.00	so i think that itself you know says a
1956.00 1957.92	lot how a wet market is actually a very
1957.92 1958.88	viable
1958.88 1962.16	alternative for consumers at home
1962.16 1964.32	i think that the wet market right is
1964.32 1966.56	like inherently in our culture
1966.56 1968.80	but at the same time it is also kind of
1968.80 1970.64	like a sunset industry
1970.64 1972.40	when i chat with the vendors you know in
1972.40 1974.32	my free time a lot of them
1974.32 1977.04	shared with me that they are old and
1977.04 1978.40	they have children but they don't
1978.40 1981.36	want to take over the business perhaps
1981.36 1983.12	the idea of selling something in a wet
1983.12 1984.88	market could be uncool to them
1984.88 1986.56	but now that we introduce the online
1986.56 1988.40	element for them it kind of get their
1988.40 1990.72	children interested
1990.72 1992.96	wet markets aren't the only alternatives
1992.96 1994.80	to supermarkets
1994.80 1997.84	remember this
1997.84 1999.76	they used to be found in every hdb
1999.76 2001.68	estate
2001.68 2003.68	family run provision shops that sell
2003.68 2006.00	pretty much everything
2006.00 2008.96	including my favorite ice creams that i
2008.96 2010.50	used to love as a kid
2010.50 2015.92	[Music]
2015.92 2017.28	since then i've hardly gone to a
2017.28 2019.04	provision store
2019.04 2020.56	in fact i can't remember the last time i
2020.56 2024.16	went to one of those
2024.16 2027.20	in the 1980s more than 3 000 provision
2027.20 2030.32	shops dotted our landscape
2030.32 2032.08	but as more supermarkets popped up
2032.08 2033.68	across the island
2033.68 2037.76	provision shops were slowly phased out
2037.76 2041.60	today less than 200 remain
2041.60 2044.40	luckily for ting ting her favorite one
2044.40 2045.04	still
2045.04 2047.22	exists
2047.22 2048.40	[Music]
2048.40 2050.72	it's close to her childhood home in
2050.72 2052.72	sarangoon
2052.72 2054.32	you know this provision shop is really
2054.32 2056.16	nostalgic for me
2056.16 2059.04	so uncle belongs to that generation of
2059.04 2060.72	provision shop owners
2060.72 2064.00	that knows every little items in a shop
2064.00 2064.40	you know
2064.40 2066.88	including their prices wow okay i want
2066.88 2068.32	to have some fun with this i want to ask
2068.32 2071.92	okay group beer
2071.92 2074.96	colgate he really remembers everything
2074.96 2076.00	okay uh
2076.00 2077.84	chicken essence bran's chicken essence
2077.84 2079.28	17.50
2079.28 2083.04	past really fast ready okay
2083.04 2085.36	uncle's remembering all his prices off
2085.36 2087.28	hand this is a requisite
2087.28 2089.12	to own a provision shop requisite it's a
2089.12 2091.68	requirement
2091.68 2094.96	ting ting is a historian she's
2094.96 2097.12	documented some of our oldest provision
2097.12 2097.84	shops
2097.84 2099.76	as part of an e-book series by the
2099.76 2102.80	national heritage board
2102.80 2105.04	well they're still relevant in fact we
2105.04 2107.36	don't realize how important a provision
2107.36 2109.52	shop is until you need something
2109.52 2112.32	suddenly something random right they
2112.32 2112.72	serve
2112.72 2116.16	the community directly very near
2116.16 2119.12	this is like at the void deck or walking
2119.12 2120.24	distance
2120.24 2122.08	nearer than usually the supermarkets
2122.08 2125.84	unless you live next door to one
2125.84 2128.56	so i know of provision shop owners who
2128.56 2130.00	will actually deliver the goods
2130.00 2132.32	upstairs at least they know who is
2132.32 2134.16	mobile who is not mobile
2134.16 2137.04	and they will go the extra distance for
2137.04 2138.24	those who needed help
2138.24 2139.92	the other thing about provision shops
2139.92 2142.24	like this is because it's a family-run
2142.24 2144.40	or personally owned
2144.40 2147.04	you can talk to the shop owners directly
2147.04 2147.52	right
2147.52 2149.44	and in whatever kind of needs that you
2149.44 2150.64	might have or something that you're
2150.64 2151.52	looking for
2151.52 2153.52	and they sell in smaller quantity
2153.52 2155.44	smaller quantities give me an example
2155.44 2156.00	that
2156.00 2157.36	so for example if you don't want to buy
2157.36 2159.36	the whole tree of eggs you don't buy 10
2159.36 2160.00	eggs
2160.00 2162.32	you want to buy by per egg you can buy a
2162.32 2163.84	bit of garlic you just want to cook that
2163.84 2164.72	one meal
2164.72 2166.96	and you know you go to the supermarket
2166.96 2168.64	you have to buy this whole bag of it
2168.64 2170.48	and then use one bit and throw the whole
2170.48 2172.48	rest away
2172.48 2174.24	tinting what do you think the pandemic
2174.24 2176.00	showed us about the
2176.00 2177.92	importance of these provision shops they
2177.92 2179.84	are a good alternative source
2179.84 2181.84	when people started stockpiling and the
2181.84 2184.00	supermarket was crowded with people
2184.00 2186.32	i i didn't like the idea of squeezing
2186.32 2187.20	with everybody
2187.20 2189.28	and queuing up so many hours and all big
2189.28 2190.64	crowd right yeah
2190.64 2192.08	so i went to the provision shop and
2192.08 2193.20	asked like do you have this and that
2193.20 2200.56	they said yeah like we have a lot of it
2200.56 2202.88	during the the pandemic period did you
2202.88 2204.56	see a surge in customers
2204.56 2206.64	coming to buy things from your store yes
2206.64 2209.12	yes yeah i was very busy every day even
2209.12 2211.36	monday my day off i also got to keep
2211.36 2213.20	open on mondays so that i won't be
2213.20 2214.08	overwhelmed on
2214.08 2216.56	tuesday so they did see this as a very
2216.56 2217.84	good alternative
2217.84 2220.32	and in fact whoever started to come that
2220.32 2221.04	then right
2221.04 2224.56	have become regulars now
2224.56 2226.16	but while some of us did turn to
2226.16 2227.84	provision shops at the height of the
2227.84 2230.32	pandemic
2230.32 2232.48	these vanishing shops faced another
2232.48 2235.20	problem
2235.20 2237.04	so were you able to meet this surge in
2237.04 2238.96	demand when these people came in to buy
2238.96 2239.44	things
2239.44 2241.12	when we couldn't get it from our regular
2241.12 2242.80	supply years we took
2242.80 2244.96	an alternative of ourselves going to the
2244.96 2246.88	shopping malls of the mega malls or the
2246.88 2248.24	essential services
2248.24 2250.64	to replenish the stock you know oh you
2250.64 2252.08	will buy from us yeah i will buy from
2252.08 2253.12	the supermarket
2253.12 2254.72	and then i will bring it back and then
2254.72 2256.56	to study in the shop and because we're
2256.56 2258.40	uh just a standalone shop so the
2258.40 2260.24	suppliers sometimes too small amount
2260.24 2260.88	they wouldn't
2260.88 2262.32	want to entertain us so that's
2262.32 2263.84	challenging yeah very challenging so
2263.84 2265.12	they will
2265.12 2266.88	supply to the those big surfboard
2266.88 2268.24	markets i also will
2268.24 2270.32	negotiate with my suppliers that maybe
2270.32 2271.44	he can give me some
2271.44 2273.36	at least some that can let me support
2273.36 2275.76	him for my residence my
2275.76 2280.64	neighborhoods
2280.64 2283.20	some of us did turn to our trusty family
2283.20 2284.48	run provision stores
2284.48 2288.32	in the early days of the pandemic
2288.32 2289.84	and while the demand was there the
2289.84 2294.72	supply simply couldn't keep up
2294.72 2296.64	hi can i get this too also uncle thank
2296.64 2298.16	you very much
2298.16 2300.88	let's face it in times of crisis the big
2300.88 2302.80	boys will always dominate our supply
2302.80 2304.32	chain
2304.32 2307.68	thank you very much uncle come again
2307.68 2311.28	but if there's one thing we've learnt
2311.28 2313.84	it is that there is a good reason to
2313.84 2316.08	keep provision shops going
2316.08 2317.76	so that they're around where we need
2317.76 2322.00	them they provide a viable alternative
2322.00 2325.28	that is if they don't close for
2325.28 2341.84	good
2341.84 2344.48	day is kind of a bro way of saying hi in
2344.48 2346.48	tamil
2346.48 2350.08	but this is the day i'm referring to
2350.08 2353.04	it's a website here day stands for daily
2353.04 2354.48	everything
2354.48 2358.16	and the man behind it jay
2358.16 2360.16	he isn't just helping provision shops
2360.16 2361.44	move online
2361.44 2363.12	he's also helped some of them ensure a
2363.12 2364.72	steady supply of goods
2364.72 2367.52	during the circuit breaker when there
2367.52 2369.20	was the long down
2369.20 2372.00	what was the gap that you saw to help
2372.00 2372.40	these
2372.40 2375.36	provision stores traditional stores are
2375.36 2376.48	very small
2376.48 2378.56	and in terms of the buying power it's
2378.56 2380.16	very small two things he doesn't have
2380.16 2380.72	the space
2380.72 2384.16	he doesn't have the kind of cash to
2384.16 2386.48	stock up so up such uh so much of
2386.48 2387.84	goods so when the lockdown
2387.84 2389.44	happened nobody was willing to supply
2389.44 2392.00	them so things were off the shelf
2392.00 2393.52	there are no resupplies so basically
2393.52 2395.04	it's an empty shop
2395.04 2396.80	what we did was we contacted all the
2396.80 2399.76	wholesalers we started to buy in bulk
2399.76 2401.68	because the thing is we had the
2401.68 2403.04	resources to buy in
2403.04 2405.60	larger volumes and with that we ended up
2405.60 2406.24	supplying
2406.24 2408.48	to the merchant stores as well so this
2408.48 2410.64	get the supply chain intact
2410.64 2412.32	it kind of still allowed them to
2412.32 2413.76	function as a business
2413.76 2416.16	but once you start to purchase wholesale
2416.16 2417.68	from suppliers
2417.68 2419.60	you could already just get that and
2419.60 2421.04	direct sales to
2421.04 2423.20	to to consumers right because the
2423.20 2425.28	majority of people who buy on e-commerce
2425.28 2426.88	are the millennials
2426.88 2430.32	but generation x basically some of them
2430.32 2432.32	are okay with buying online but most of
2432.32 2434.72	them prefer to just walk down to buy
2434.72 2436.40	so the thing is we still had to cater to
2436.40 2438.40	this group of people so you guys have
2438.40 2438.96	had
2438.96 2440.56	close interaction with a lot of these
2440.56 2442.00	little stalls right so
2442.00 2443.68	in your interactions with them right
2443.68 2445.12	what kind of position
2445.12 2447.68	do they have in the greater marketplace
2447.68 2448.16	for
2448.16 2450.96	goods and and provisions that's
2450.96 2452.88	important for
2452.88 2454.24	singaporean communities i think it's a
2454.24 2456.16	very good question to me i'll say reason
2456.16 2456.88	is to have
2456.88 2458.80	multiple channels to make sure the goods
2458.80 2460.00	flow through the market
2460.00 2462.56	supermarkets have limitations it's
2462.56 2464.56	costly to actually go into a supermarket
2464.56 2466.32	to get your products listed
2466.32 2467.92	there's a lot of fees a lot of things
2467.92 2469.44	you have to pay for so
2469.44 2470.96	many of them use a traditional channel
2470.96 2472.72	to actually push the other goods
2472.72 2474.16	and that's one of the biggest thing in
2474.16 2476.00	terms of the supply chain
2476.00 2478.16	so supermarkets play a key part probably
2478.16 2480.24	about 35 percent of our sales
2480.24 2481.84	but traditional merchants also
2481.84 2483.92	contribute close to about 20
2483.92 2485.92	so it's about time we start respecting
2485.92 2487.68	them start taking them serious and see
2487.68 2489.44	how we can help them
2489.44 2491.92	survive at the same time adapt to this
2491.92 2494.08	new norm
2494.08 2497.36	our provision shops are invaluable
2497.36 2502.08	not just because they're convenient
2502.08 2503.84	there are so many gems you'll find in
2503.84 2505.12	provision stores like this that you
2505.12 2506.88	won't find anywhere else
2506.88 2508.56	and i'm not just talking about biscuits
2508.56 2510.94	like this
2510.94 2516.48	[Music]
2516.48 2518.80	hi guys take a look at the wall behind
2518.80 2519.84	me these are
2519.84 2522.24	scenes that you hardly find today except
2522.24 2524.64	in some very old school provision stores
2524.64 2527.12	and then you have savory stuff you've
2527.12 2528.96	got these wheel cookies these lovely
2528.96 2530.56	tasty things
2530.56 2534.16	and then some very asmr fish crackers
2534.16 2536.08	crunch crunch crunch
2536.08 2538.56	but my favorite of all the ultimate
2538.56 2539.76	thing that i like to find in these
2539.76 2540.72	provision stores
2540.72 2545.36	is a cup of gem biscuits
2545.36 2547.68	but i've learned that nostalgia isn't
2547.68 2549.84	the only reason why we need to have them
2549.84 2553.68	stick around
2553.68 2555.12	so for example if you don't want to buy
2555.12 2557.04	the whole tree of eggs you don't buy 10
2557.04 2557.68	eggs
2557.68 2559.92	you want to buy by per egg sometimes
2559.92 2561.60	they'll make the exception if they don't
2561.60 2562.64	usually sell that
2562.64 2566.32	in small quantity supermarkets tend to
2566.32 2568.72	sell things in pre-packed sizes
2568.72 2571.52	so if i wanted to buy say a single chili
2571.52 2573.36	or two pieces of lemongrass
2573.36 2576.40	or three stalks of spring onion it's
2576.40 2577.84	going to be tough i had to buy the whole
2577.84 2578.56	pack
2578.56 2580.64	and these packs are measured for
2580.64 2582.08	generally a family of three to four
2582.08 2583.44	people
2583.44 2588.16	but what if you stay alone
2588.16 2590.24	so one more reason to look at where we
2590.24 2592.72	buy all of our food is to realize how
2592.72 2594.64	much of it we tend to waste
2594.64 2596.56	[Music]
2596.56 2600.24	in 2019 we wasted more than 700
2600.24 2604.24	000 tons of food that's about 20 percent
2604.24 2609.04	more than a decade ago
2609.04 2611.20	one company wants to stop this
2611.20 2613.44	unnecessary waste
2613.44 2615.44	and they're starting by helping you shop
2615.44 2617.28	differently
2617.28 2620.72	they're sending these to your house
2620.72 2624.08	pre-portioned meals for everyday cooking
2624.08 2629.12	[Music]
2629.12 2630.40	so they're supposed to be like your
2630.40 2632.48	home-cooked daily meals but without all
2632.48 2633.84	the fuss
2633.84 2635.84	these ingredients are measured out no
2635.84 2636.96	more and no less
2636.96 2639.76	it's just out of the box and into the
2639.76 2644.40	pan
2644.40 2647.12	prepped the meal kit company doesn't
2647.12 2648.72	just want to make cooking quick
2648.72 2652.24	and easy they also want to keep it
2652.24 2656.08	waste free
2656.08 2658.00	the processes here at prepped are very
2658.00 2659.36	geared towards
2659.36 2661.92	minimizing food waste being exact to the
2661.92 2662.64	portions
2662.64 2664.96	why are you guys so big on this i mean
2664.96 2667.92	if anything the pandemic challenged
2667.92 2669.28	the fact that the status quo that we
2669.28 2671.12	take for granted is actually very
2671.12 2672.24	fragile
2672.24 2673.84	you can blame supermarkets a little bit
2673.84 2675.36	for the overbuying because they control
2675.36 2677.60	the portion sizes that we can buy but we
2677.60 2678.88	really aren't doing
2678.88 2681.68	enough as individuals as a society to
2681.68 2683.44	reduce food waste
2683.44 2685.68	there was an nea study that found that
2685.68 2686.48	50
2686.48 2688.08	of the total waste that a household
2688.08 2689.60	throws out
2689.60 2692.88	is food waste
2692.88 2694.80	now you might not have heard of meal
2694.80 2697.36	kits but in the u.s they've been around
2697.36 2698.88	for years
2698.88 2701.44	and when kovite 19 hit and cities there
2701.44 2702.88	entered lockdown
2702.88 2705.04	demand for these home-cooked meals
2705.04 2706.96	soared
2706.96 2709.12	so can they be a viable alternative to
2709.12 2711.52	supermarkets
2711.52 2713.44	it is an option out there so that people
2713.44 2715.36	don't only think oh if i want to buy
2715.36 2717.36	fresh food or i want to cook at home
2717.36 2719.84	the supermarket is my only option and
2719.84 2720.80	the second thing is
2720.80 2722.96	working from home yep so previously when
2722.96 2724.88	you're in an office you would run down
2724.88 2725.68	just by
2725.68 2727.84	what you need for that meal but now that
2727.84 2729.52	everyone's working from home
2729.52 2731.76	there's also a lot more grocery shopping
2731.76 2733.68	happening a lot more people going out
2733.68 2735.36	and buying in the quantities that they
2735.36 2737.60	may not necessarily be using
2737.60 2740.64	and so then you get that over buying
2740.64 2742.48	happening to a larger extent as well as
2742.48 2743.76	more people stay home
2743.76 2745.60	believe that they will cook more and
2745.60 2747.28	maybe don't end up finishing all that
2747.28 2750.88	dubai
2750.88 2752.96	it's not just about changing where we
2752.96 2754.56	buy but controlling
2754.56 2758.40	what we buy wet markets probation shops
2758.40 2761.60	meal kits they all allow you to do that
2761.60 2765.52	in their own small way
2765.52 2767.44	as a food lover interested in all things
2767.44 2769.28	food i would be extremely disappointed
2769.28 2770.48	to lose them
2770.48 2773.04	i have learned that as consumers we must
2773.04 2774.24	support them to keep them
2774.24 2776.40	in business they are essential they
2776.40 2779.04	provide an overlapping but crucial
2779.04 2781.20	role in singapore's grocery supply
2781.20 2782.48	business
2782.48 2784.56	and more options can only be good in a
2784.56 2790.15	time like this
