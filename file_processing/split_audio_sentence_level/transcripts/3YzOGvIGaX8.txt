0.00 0.72	[Music]
0.72 3.12	a vaccine usually takes over 10 years to
3.12 3.92	develop
3.92 6.00	but against all odds in just eight
6.00 6.96	months
6.96 10.88	seven vaccines are now approved for use
10.88 12.88	the first batch of vaccines arrived in
12.88 15.36	singapore on the 21st of december
15.36 17.92	making us the first country in asia to
17.92 19.76	approve and take in the vaccine
19.76 23.28	developed by pfizer and biontech
23.28 25.12	[Music]
25.12 28.00	vaccination is free for all singaporeans
28.00 28.32	and
28.32 31.36	long-term residents but it's voluntary
31.36 34.24	will you take the corvette 19 vaccine
34.24 34.64	well
34.64 36.08	if you've been in two minds about it
36.08 37.76	then you want to stay tuned because
37.76 39.60	joining me today i have top medical
39.60 40.48	experts and
40.48 42.32	minister lawrence wong who co-chairs
42.32 44.88	singapore's maoti ministry task force on
44.88 46.96	covet 19 and they're here to answer all
46.96 48.32	your questions
48.32 56.84	this is a special episode of talking
56.84 59.68	point
59.68 61.52	minister i'm going to start off with you
61.52 62.88	why don't we just make vaccination
62.88 64.48	compulsory for everyone
64.48 65.84	i think that's a question steve that
65.84 67.76	many people have asked i think we should
67.76 69.76	first recognize that very very few
69.76 71.44	vaccines are mandated
71.44 73.28	be it in singapore or anywhere in the
73.28 74.56	world even
74.56 76.72	if you look at a vaccine that's safe and
76.72 78.00	effective
78.00 80.48	there may be some some segments within
80.48 82.80	the population that are not eligible for
82.80 84.08	the vaccine
84.08 86.56	and we also want to respect people's
86.56 87.52	choices
87.52 89.44	so minister have you had your shot yet
89.44 91.12	no i haven't steve
91.12 93.76	we have worked out a prioritization plan
93.76 95.92	we are going with healthcare workers
95.92 98.64	those in the front line as priority
98.64 100.40	thereafter we get to the elderly
100.40 101.44	starting with those in
101.44 104.64	70s and above cabinet ministers and the
104.64 106.88	prime minister if we do it we try as
106.88 108.68	much as possible to follow the
108.68 111.20	prioritization protocol that has been
111.20 111.76	put out
111.76 113.52	if we were to do it earlier i think it
113.52 116.32	gives some confidence to the public that
116.32 118.32	the vaccines are safe and effective
118.32 120.48	and we want to encourage all
120.48 122.40	singaporeans and everyone in singapore
122.40 124.48	to take up the vaccines as well
124.48 126.48	so is it safe to say that all of you
126.48 127.76	here agree that
127.76 130.08	everyone should be vaccinated yes yes
130.08 130.96	yes definitely
130.96 132.56	in fact we will raise our hands for the
132.56 134.48	vaccination but we just don't want to
134.48 135.84	jump the queue
135.84 137.68	well before we go on further let's take
137.68 139.68	a quick look at the three types of
139.68 140.64	vaccines
140.64 144.24	that singapore is bringing in
144.24 145.84	singapore has bought three types of
145.84 148.32	vaccines pfizer biontech
148.32 151.60	moderna and cylovac both the pfizer
151.60 153.68	biontech and moderna vaccines
153.68 156.48	use what is described as messenger rna
156.48 158.00	technology
158.00 160.00	this involves injecting snippets of the
160.00 163.36	corvette 19 genetic code into a patient
163.36 166.40	put simply it's a recipe to direct the
166.40 168.64	production of a specific part of the
168.64 169.44	virus
169.44 171.92	the spike protein to trigger an immune
171.92 172.96	response
172.96 175.44	without actually exposing the patient to
175.44 177.04	the virus
177.04 178.80	both vaccines are said to have an
178.80 181.92	efficacy rate of about 95 percent
181.92 184.08	china made cyberback vaccine on the
184.08 184.96	other hand
184.96 188.00	uses an inactivated covet-19 virus
188.00 190.16	to trigger an immune response when
190.16 192.72	injected into a patient
192.72 195.36	but there is a lack of specific results
195.36 199.20	on its efficacy
199.20 201.52	the pfizer biotech vaccine is already
201.52 202.80	being used in britain
202.80 205.84	and the us modernist vaccine only in the
205.84 206.80	u.s
206.80 209.76	as of 7th january cynovac is yet to be
209.76 212.40	used by any country
212.40 215.68	so the cylovac vaccine from china hasn't
215.68 216.08	been
216.08 218.00	as widely used and as we just heard
218.00 219.92	there's no conclusive study on it yet so
219.92 221.44	minister why did we pick
221.44 224.16	that as one of the vaccines to be used
224.16 225.36	in singapore well
225.36 227.12	you have to understand that we started
227.12 229.68	this process very early on in the start
229.68 231.60	of the outbreak we knew that vaccines
231.60 232.88	were important
232.88 236.16	and so as early as april we convened an
236.16 239.28	expert panel chaired by
239.28 242.08	our head of civil service to look at how
242.08 242.88	we can
242.88 245.28	make early purchases of vaccines for
245.28 246.40	singapore
246.40 249.04	we have to make early bets in order for
249.04 250.88	singapore to be near the front of the
250.88 252.40	queue for vaccines
252.40 255.44	and at that time there is no
255.44 258.00	clinical data available from any vaccine
258.00 259.44	company in terms of
259.44 262.48	full-fledged information only very early
262.48 265.04	stage clinical information was available
265.04 267.04	from all the many vaccine candidates
267.04 269.20	they narrowed down to 35
269.20 271.84	and then they drilled down even more to
271.84 273.68	look at safety effectiveness
273.68 276.00	based on whatever preliminary data that
276.00 277.44	was available then
277.44 280.64	and eventually they decided on the tree
280.64 282.32	and that's a tree that we have made
282.32 284.32	advanced purchases for with the aim of
284.32 286.48	building a diversified portfolio of
286.48 287.36	vaccines
287.36 289.20	that will be safe and effective for use
289.20 291.20	in singapore and we have three now but
291.20 292.64	that's not the end of it
292.64 294.72	but which is safer injecting an
294.72 296.16	inactivated virus
296.16 299.04	or using the genetic code of the virus i
299.04 300.48	think we must understand that all the
300.48 301.44	vaccines that
301.44 303.36	are approved in singapore are safe and
303.36 304.80	efficacious so
304.80 306.80	we're not looking at is one you know in
306.80 308.32	a way safer than the other
308.32 310.96	and so on but right now the only vaccine
310.96 311.76	that's available
311.76 314.56	is the divisor bioentech vaccine at the
314.56 315.36	same time
315.36 316.88	you will see that once additional
316.88 318.64	vaccines come on board there will be
318.64 320.16	some vaccines that can be used in
320.16 321.68	certain sub-populations
321.68 324.24	for example defies a vaccine cannot be
324.24 325.60	used in people who have
325.60 327.76	severe allergic reactions it cannot be
327.76 328.80	used at this point
328.80 330.96	in children below 16 in pregnant women
330.96 332.48	in severely immunocompromised
332.48 333.44	individuals
333.44 335.28	other vaccines might be able to be used
335.28 336.64	in different populations okay
336.64 338.80	so we need to wait for more information
338.80 341.36	and it is which vaccine is more
341.36 344.16	uh sort of applicable or relevant to
344.16 345.60	that particular population if it's
345.60 346.40	offered right
346.40 348.08	we would encourage people to get that
348.08 350.64	vaccine but as we are talking about this
350.64 352.48	a new strain came about what's the point
352.48 353.84	of taking the vaccine
353.84 356.48	yeah well mutations occur all the time
356.48 358.08	so far as we can tell
358.08 359.76	it seems like it probably would still
359.76 361.76	work it's being actively tested
361.76 363.60	and we'll know very soon because more
363.60 365.20	than two three million people now in the
365.20 366.48	uk in the us
366.48 368.48	have received the vaccine one of our
368.48 370.24	bioinformatics expert
370.24 373.12	doctor sebastian morvis row he likens
373.12 374.16	mutations
374.16 376.32	to like the different number plate or
376.32 377.68	color of a car
377.68 380.48	the same make same model different
380.48 381.36	license plate
381.36 383.36	we see many of them all around the time
383.36 384.48	and sometimes you know you
384.48 386.32	might have a car with new tires it might
386.32 387.52	you know be a bit more efficient move
387.52 389.12	faster and so on but it's still the same
389.12 389.68	make
389.68 392.08	at this point there's no evidence that
392.08 393.76	it has changed to another make another
393.76 394.64	model
394.64 396.96	another brand we understand a nurse in
396.96 398.56	california after taking the the first
398.56 399.68	vaccination shot
399.68 402.08	was then tested positive for the virus
402.08 403.12	it's the timing
403.12 405.28	it's too short what do you mean by that
405.28 407.20	that means your body needs some time to
407.20 408.96	develop an immune response right after
408.96 410.64	the first dose only
410.64 413.20	so soon after she actually had the dose
413.20 413.84	she
413.84 416.00	picked up the infection and she may have
416.00 417.36	actually been incubating at the time
417.36 419.04	that she had the vaccination done
419.04 420.64	so one shouldn't read this as though
420.64 422.24	it's a vaccine failure you have to wait
422.24 424.08	for the vaccine to work
424.08 425.36	and it takes time that's the other point
425.36 426.64	that's important for the public to
426.64 427.60	understand
427.60 429.52	for example the fisa vaccine
429.52 431.92	specifically you need to take two doses
431.92 434.08	three weeks apart and after the second
434.08 436.24	dose it takes about one to two weeks
436.24 438.88	for the full you know immune reaction to
438.88 439.68	develop
439.68 441.44	so that means a total of about four to
441.44 443.76	five weeks okay after
443.76 445.84	the first dose is given now in between
445.84 447.68	that time that individual
447.68 449.92	is still susceptible to of course
449.92 451.28	exposure and and
451.28 454.16	that's why it is important for us now in
454.16 454.88	singapore
454.88 456.32	for us to roll out this vaccination
456.32 458.00	program okay because when you roll it
458.00 458.24	out
458.24 460.16	in you know a situation where you have
460.16 461.28	you have an epidemic you have a lot of
461.28 461.92	cases
461.92 463.04	then the situation that you had
463.04 465.92	mentioned in this uh person in the u.s
465.92 467.60	may occur because you are trying to
467.60 470.00	vaccinate while the virus is circulating
470.00 472.16	it's much better to vaccinate when you
472.16 474.16	have very little virus circulating
474.16 477.12	such that if a virus should you know be
477.12 478.56	introduced in the future
478.56 481.60	you have a population that is immune and
481.60 484.88	then you know um right sort of prevent
484.88 487.28	any outbreak from occurring so minister
487.28 488.56	once all the vaccines are rolled out
488.56 489.92	will people be given the choice to
489.92 490.40	choose
490.40 493.52	which vaccine they want to take at this
493.52 495.44	point in time we have pfizer only
495.44 497.12	there's nothing to choose from
497.12 499.12	so let's go with pfizer get people
499.12 501.52	vaccinated on the pfizer vaccine
501.52 503.44	if later on other vaccines are
503.44 505.28	authorized be it moderna
505.28 507.60	or synovac then we have to think about
507.60 509.68	whether choice may be extended
509.68 512.64	or as vernon highlighted perhaps some
512.64 513.68	vaccines work
513.68 515.60	better for certain sub-segments of the
515.60 517.92	population and then we might allocate
517.92 520.40	vaccines differently as well i'd like to
520.40 521.60	know if
521.60 523.20	the government would help to cope my
523.20 525.36	medical bills should i get any severe
525.36 536.64	side effects from it
536.64 538.40	and welcome back we've been talking
538.40 540.40	about colvit 19 vaccines and
540.40 541.44	you know personally i'll take the
541.44 543.60	vaccine because it will not just protect
543.60 545.52	me but also those around me and of
545.52 547.68	course i want to keep them safe but
547.68 550.16	some singaporeans are still unsure about
550.16 550.72	getting
550.72 552.72	vaccinated and we have some of their
552.72 554.08	questions right now
554.08 556.00	there are studies showing that the
556.00 557.92	vaccine can cause
557.92 561.28	cancer and also effects on
561.28 564.64	our health i'm 73 i have high blood
564.64 565.68	pressure
565.68 568.96	i have diabetes and i have poor kidney
568.96 570.56	function
570.56 573.60	my concern is that i will get worse side
573.60 574.40	effects
574.40 577.44	than a healthier person so very valid
577.44 579.12	concerns from people there the first one
579.12 579.68	from
579.68 581.20	lisa she was saying that it might
581.20 582.96	actually cause cancer
582.96 584.88	so at this point there's no evidence
584.88 586.80	that this vaccine will
586.80 588.88	result in such a side effect i mean most
588.88 590.96	of the side effects that we have seen
590.96 593.76	from the studies are mild side effects
593.76 595.12	and also
595.12 596.96	the one that is known which is the
596.96 598.80	severe allergic reaction in people
598.80 602.08	the mrna component itself does not
602.08 602.88	incorporate
602.88 606.08	into our human dna it uh in fact after
606.08 609.04	about 48 hours just sort of you know
609.04 611.28	dissipates in the body and disintegrates
611.28 612.48	so
612.48 614.16	there's no evidence at this point that
614.16 615.76	there's any such concern
615.76 617.52	and profound the second question
617.52 619.28	regarding those who already have
619.28 620.80	existing health conditions yes
620.80 622.40	they're concerned they may suffer more
622.40 624.32	serious side effects i think annie has
624.32 626.08	raised a very important point
626.08 628.00	but it's precisely that particular group
628.00 629.84	of individuals who are older
629.84 631.36	that have the core mobilities that she
631.36 633.44	mentioned that tend to get
633.44 635.52	more ill and tend to have a higher
635.52 636.48	mortality
636.48 638.72	and it's specifically this group that we
638.72 640.48	hope will take it up
640.48 642.64	and get vaccinated over in the uk after
642.64 643.52	the vaccination
643.52 646.24	is given the doctors are monitoring
646.24 647.44	patients they have them stick around for
647.44 648.80	a period of time 15 minutes they'll
648.80 650.32	monitor them i mean is that something we
650.32 651.76	plan to do as well minister
651.76 654.24	for sure we will be monitoring very
654.24 656.08	closely everyone who is vaccinated in
656.08 656.64	fact
656.64 659.04	the authorities are looking at data not
659.04 660.24	just from singapore but they are
660.24 661.60	monitoring data from
661.60 663.52	the vaccination program everywhere in
663.52 665.20	the world clinical trials when it did
665.20 666.56	devise a vaccine
666.56 668.48	quite a number of those individuals were
668.48 670.08	in fact individuals with comorbid
670.08 671.92	medical conditions because this are the
671.92 672.96	target crew
672.96 674.08	for the vaccines because of the
674.08 676.00	complications and of the many millions
676.00 677.68	of people who are vaccinated now
677.68 679.92	you know in the uk the u.s and elsewhere
679.92 681.52	there's a huge diversity
681.52 683.28	in terms of you know age co-morbid
683.28 684.72	medical conditions etc
684.72 686.40	so there is a wealth of data showing
686.40 688.32	that you know the vaccine
688.32 690.48	is safe okay we're going to take another
690.48 692.08	question it's impossible for
692.08 695.04	us to know what are the three to five to
695.04 695.76	ten year
695.76 697.60	long term effects that it will have like
697.60 699.84	for example if and when i want to have
699.84 702.64	kids will it be harder to conceive like
702.64 703.28	any other
703.28 705.36	drug vaccine we will have to of course
705.36 707.20	monitor over the longer term
707.20 709.20	to see if there are any rare side
709.20 710.32	effects that might occur
710.32 712.08	but at this point there's no evidence
712.08 713.44	that for example
713.44 715.68	ability to conceive would be an issue
715.68 717.20	how concerned should i be about
717.20 718.32	long-term side effects
718.32 719.36	the likelihood that there will be
719.36 722.40	long-term issues i think is very remote
722.40 724.00	place safe per se we have not
724.00 725.60	recommended that if you are
725.60 727.28	pregnant at present you will take the
727.28 728.96	vaccine wait until after you deliver
728.96 730.64	before you take the vaccine
730.64 731.92	i guess one of the concerns is also
731.92 733.36	because things have happened so fast
733.36 734.96	there is concern that the vaccines may
734.96 736.40	not be as safe as
736.40 738.00	what was traditionally the actual
738.00 739.76	clinical trials process
739.76 741.68	right the reason the companies have been
741.68 743.28	able to shorten the process
743.28 745.68	are twofold number one we are in a
745.68 746.48	pandemic
746.48 748.80	there's no shortage of volunteers
748.80 750.64	wanting to come forward perhaps
750.64 752.40	not in a country like singapore where
752.40 754.16	the virus is
754.16 757.60	not not raging but in uk us there are no
757.60 759.52	shortage of volunteers coming forward
759.52 761.12	they all won the vaccine
761.12 764.16	right now right and number two they have
764.16 765.92	been able to get these trials
765.92 769.12	going on a concurrent basis not
769.12 771.52	trimming back not compromising but in
771.52 772.40	parallel
772.40 775.28	and therefore shortening the time so the
775.28 777.68	entire process of validation
777.68 780.64	testing trialling looking at the data
780.64 783.28	has not been compromised a single bit
783.28 786.88	so no shortcuts that's right
786.88 788.32	we have one more question okay let's
788.32 790.96	listen i'd like to know if um
790.96 792.48	the government would help to copy my
792.48 794.64	medical bills should i get any severe
794.64 795.92	side effects from it
795.92 797.60	well that's a it's a very relevant
797.60 799.68	concern in fact not just for covid
799.68 802.40	vaccine but for any vaccination program
802.40 804.56	after we've authorized we've verified
804.56 806.16	that safe and effective
806.16 809.28	one can never rule out the possibilities
809.28 811.12	of a very rare
811.12 814.32	and serious side effect effect occurring
814.32 816.96	it will be very rare but it may happen
816.96 818.48	so we've been looking at this and we
818.48 820.32	think that there is a
820.32 822.24	possibility of putting in place a
822.24 824.88	vaccination injury assistance program
824.88 827.60	where the government comes in for such k
827.60 830.00	instances to help pay for the medical
830.00 830.80	cost
830.80 832.96	associated with it so moh has been
832.96 834.88	looking at the parameters the
834.88 837.36	quantum of assistance the conditions and
837.36 839.12	the eligibility criteria
839.12 840.72	so they will be putting out details that
840.72 842.56	in quite a short while
842.56 844.80	do the authorities have any alternatives
844.80 846.80	for those singaporeans
846.80 849.84	who are unable to get this vaccine due
849.84 852.00	to their autoimmune disorders
852.00 854.24	how about young children below the age
854.24 855.44	of 12
855.44 858.96	we as parents given a choice to say yes
858.96 859.68	or no
859.68 862.56	for children to take up this vaccine
862.56 862.96	maybe
862.96 865.04	i can answer both of these questions
865.04 867.28	first currently for autoimmune
867.28 869.12	conditions it very much depends on the
869.12 870.96	underlying condition
870.96 874.08	in so far as the testing is concerned if
874.08 874.40	the
874.40 877.44	condition is under control and managing
877.44 878.48	physician feels
878.48 881.36	it's safe enough we will probably allow
881.36 882.00	it
882.00 883.76	now because none of these vaccines have
883.76 885.92	been comprehensively tested below the
885.92 887.12	age of 16
887.12 889.36	for pfizer in particular we are not
889.36 891.20	recommending it for children at present
891.20 893.04	we need to look at this holistically
893.04 895.20	vaccine is just one part of a broader
895.20 897.12	suite of tools that we have
897.12 899.60	to protect ourselves so to the question
899.60 901.28	if i don't have the vaccine is there
901.28 903.44	anything else i can do to protect myself
903.44 904.48	the answer is yes
904.48 906.40	many many things all the basic
906.40 908.48	precautions that we have been
908.48 910.40	putting out advising and that we have
910.40 913.12	all started to cultivate good habits for
913.12 916.48	like hand hygiene wearing of masks
916.48 919.28	maintaining safe distance these are all
919.28 920.96	ways in which people can protect
920.96 921.76	themselves
921.76 923.36	well we have someone on the line who has
923.36 925.44	just had a vaccination sarah lim joins
925.44 926.72	us now she's among the first batch of
926.72 928.80	singaporeans to be vaccinated
928.80 930.08	all right well sarah thanks for joining
930.08 932.08	us uh yeah we know you've just had your
932.08 933.52	vaccination very recently talk us
933.52 935.12	through the process what was it like for
935.12 936.32	you
936.32 939.84	uh it felt like an invite at the point
939.84 942.00	of injection
942.00 944.48	uh i was under the 30 minutes of
944.48 946.00	observation
946.00 948.64	to look out for any reaction from the
948.64 949.36	vaccine
949.36 952.72	but there was none okay well sarah do
952.72 954.00	stay with us i'll just come back to the
954.00 955.28	panel do we know the proportion of
955.28 957.04	singaporeans who had suffered any
957.04 959.52	side effects after taking the vaccine so
959.52 960.32	far
960.32 963.68	no no so far nobody no so from what we
963.68 965.04	know for the
965.04 967.28	individuals in ncid who have received
967.28 968.48	the vaccine
968.48 970.64	some of them have had sort of you know
970.64 972.48	the usual
972.48 974.88	post-vaccination effects to be expected
974.88 975.92	for any vaccine
975.92 977.36	and these usually go away after a few
977.36 979.36	days i'm not sure whether sarah had
979.36 980.64	experienced any of these
980.64 983.28	yes i experienced soreness on the first
983.28 984.88	two days
984.88 988.48	around the injection area like any any
988.48 990.32	other vaccination
990.32 992.88	so on the third day it actually subsided
992.88 993.52	i don't
993.52 996.16	have any redness or soreness over the
996.16 996.64	area
996.64 999.84	i do felt a little bit tired okay but
999.84 1003.04	it was it was not unusual after any
1003.04 1004.00	vaccination
1004.00 1005.68	but this is what sarah has gone through
1005.68 1007.36	is the common
1007.36 1010.80	documented experience across millions of
1010.80 1012.32	people around the world who have been
1012.32 1013.20	vaccinated
1013.20 1015.28	so it's not just one data point you look
1015.28 1017.28	at america you look at uk
1017.28 1019.84	many many people i mean it's been just
1019.84 1021.36	like what sarah has gone through it's a
1021.36 1022.40	bit of an end bite
1022.40 1024.56	you experience a bit of soreness a bit
1024.56 1026.16	of tiredness and then it fades away
1026.16 1027.28	after one two days
1027.28 1029.20	and then you get on with life knowing
1029.20 1031.44	that now you are safer you are protected
1031.44 1032.88	once taking the vaccine doesn't mean
1032.88 1045.36	that i can travel out to other countries
1045.36 1048.56	well i still have to wear the mask after
1048.56 1051.44	i get the vaccine with the vaccination
1051.44 1052.00	does it mean
1052.00 1054.16	that you know the way we play and work
1054.16 1055.60	will change fundamentally
1055.60 1056.96	for instance know the split team
1056.96 1058.88	enrichments at work to even social
1058.88 1060.08	gatherings and
1060.08 1061.28	what we see that the return of
1061.28 1063.44	entertainment like concerts right so we
1063.44 1064.72	just heard from a few singaporeans
1064.72 1065.28	they're all
1065.28 1066.88	asking you know how would this vaccine
1066.88 1069.12	really change our lives can we
1069.12 1071.44	go back to uh happier days so to speak
1071.44 1072.40	but minister
1072.40 1074.48	is getting a vaccine a guaranteed
1074.48 1076.32	protection against kobe 19.
1076.32 1078.80	well i think the level of protection for
1078.80 1080.96	yourself when you are vaccinated is very
1080.96 1081.60	high
1081.60 1084.32	as we have seen right it protects you
1084.32 1086.80	based on the clinical trials 95
1086.80 1090.32	efficacy so if i'm vaccinated i protect
1090.32 1091.92	myself but can i protect
1091.92 1094.96	others the answer is probably yes you
1094.96 1096.32	will reduce the risk
1096.32 1098.88	but to what extent will transmission
1098.88 1099.52	risk be
1099.52 1103.28	reduced we don't know the answer yet so
1103.28 1105.84	for now for now if any one of us were to
1105.84 1107.28	be vaccinated
1107.28 1109.68	prevailing safe distancing measures will
1109.68 1111.52	still apply we still have to wear masks
1111.52 1114.00	we have to comply with all the rules
1114.00 1116.64	at some point in time when we have more
1116.64 1118.72	data we may start to allow for some
1118.72 1120.72	relaxation of the requirements for
1120.72 1121.76	example
1121.76 1124.08	it may be that we have a large gathering
1124.08 1125.20	say a mice
1125.20 1127.36	event or a concert which happens today
1127.36 1128.84	and we require
1128.84 1132.24	pre-event testing for participants now
1132.24 1133.44	it may well be that
1133.44 1135.60	somebody who is vaccinated he can use
1135.60 1136.72	his vaccination
1136.72 1139.76	certificate and that will substitute for
1139.76 1140.72	testing
1140.72 1143.04	that's entirely possible once taking the
1143.04 1144.80	vaccine doesn't mean that i can travel
1144.80 1147.44	to other countries and once coming back
1147.44 1148.64	to singapore
1148.64 1150.96	will i still have to stop any mandatory
1150.96 1151.92	regulations
1151.92 1154.56	such as the stay home notice that's the
1154.56 1156.56	one thing that's on many many people's
1156.56 1157.44	minds
1157.44 1160.56	if i get vaccinated can i travel
1160.56 1162.72	freely and there are two parts to this
1162.72 1163.84	answer first
1163.84 1165.84	when you travel abroad it depends on the
1165.84 1168.56	other receiving countries requirements
1168.56 1171.36	regulations we have no control of that
1171.36 1173.28	even without a vaccine today
1173.28 1175.44	many singaporeans can already travel
1175.44 1177.36	freely to other countries without a
1177.36 1178.00	quarantine
1178.00 1181.12	there because they regard singaporeans
1181.12 1181.44	as
1181.44 1184.40	coming from a low risk jurisdiction
1184.40 1186.16	right so i think with a vaccination it
1186.16 1187.60	will certainly help
1187.60 1189.92	but those are regulations that are
1189.92 1191.60	outside of our control
1191.60 1193.84	but when you come back to singapore
1193.84 1196.08	today you have to serve a 14-day
1196.08 1198.16	stay-home notice requirement 14-day
1198.16 1199.12	quarantine
1199.12 1200.72	now if you have the vaccination you
1200.72 1202.64	travel to a high-risk place you come
1202.64 1203.12	back
1203.12 1206.56	can that shm be shortened or even done
1206.56 1208.56	away with completely
1208.56 1210.72	that's the big question we still don't
1210.72 1212.80	know the extent to which a vaccination
1212.80 1214.16	can completely
1214.16 1217.04	or how significantly will help reduce
1217.04 1218.48	transmission risk
1218.48 1221.52	so those studies are still pending
1221.52 1223.60	if indeed the data shows that
1223.60 1225.12	transmission risk can
1225.12 1227.92	come down significantly with vaccination
1227.92 1228.96	then certainly
1228.96 1232.64	we will consider reducing drastically
1232.64 1234.08	the shn or even
1234.08 1236.32	doing away with it some are hearing that
1236.32 1237.92	you know flights may require that you be
1237.92 1239.60	vaccinated before you can even get on
1239.60 1240.80	board the flight
1240.80 1244.08	yeah it may be um it's still too early
1244.08 1244.56	to say
1244.56 1246.64	i know there are one or two airlines
1246.64 1248.00	that have indicated they might
1248.00 1251.04	require vaccination as a requirement
1251.04 1254.08	it may happen but but you know it's
1254.08 1255.04	still early days
1255.04 1257.44	i don't think the entire airline
1257.44 1259.20	aviation industry is
1259.20 1261.84	is unanimous in moving in this direction
1261.84 1262.72	yet
1262.72 1264.64	overall if a larger number of the
1264.64 1266.24	population significant number of the
1266.24 1267.12	population
1267.12 1270.00	have been vaccinated and therefore are
1270.00 1272.24	relatively immune to the condition
1272.24 1274.96	the ability of an infectious individual
1274.96 1276.72	to then spread to a large number of
1276.72 1278.40	individuals becomes significantly
1278.40 1279.28	impacted
1279.28 1281.68	and we will no longer see large
1281.68 1282.32	outbreaks
1282.32 1284.24	but that required a large proportion of
1284.24 1285.44	the population to be
1285.44 1287.28	vaccinated i mean what kind of numbers
1287.28 1288.40	are we looking at here how much of the
1288.40 1289.36	population
1289.36 1292.32	there's no magic number that we can say
1292.32 1293.68	at the moment because we don't
1293.68 1296.24	yet have the data but what we will know
1296.24 1298.16	is that we will need high coverage that
1298.16 1298.96	means that
1298.96 1301.44	whoever is eligible for the vaccine
1301.44 1302.80	should get vaccinated
1302.80 1305.28	so that we can reach that target a lot
1305.28 1306.96	quicker and have that collective
1306.96 1308.24	protection
1308.24 1311.20	no country is safe until every country
1311.20 1312.16	is safe
1312.16 1314.64	even if we have a very high percentage
1314.64 1316.88	of people in singapore being vaccinated
1316.88 1318.08	we will not be safe
1318.08 1320.40	until the whole world is vaccinated it
1320.40 1322.24	will take a long time for the world to
1322.24 1323.60	be vaccinated
1323.60 1325.76	not one year not within this year for
1325.76 1326.72	sure
1326.72 1329.92	it may take two years i don't know so
1329.92 1332.96	the reality this is a long fight a
1332.96 1333.68	vaccine
1333.68 1336.64	is certainly a very important weapon in
1336.64 1337.84	our arsenal
1337.84 1340.32	but it's not a silver bullet because
1340.32 1342.00	it's voluntary we must expect that there
1342.00 1343.76	will be some who will choose not to get
1343.76 1345.28	vaccinated possibly yes
1345.28 1347.20	what will happen to them will life be
1347.20 1349.20	different for them it could very well be
1349.20 1351.52	there will be these tangible benefits
1351.52 1353.04	and those who choose not to be
1353.04 1354.48	vaccinated well
1354.48 1356.32	then you have to live with more frequent
1356.32 1358.24	tests you have to live with quarantines
1358.24 1359.12	you have to live with
1359.12 1360.72	all of these other additional
1360.72 1363.12	requirements even if we
1363.12 1365.12	reach that sort of hurt immunity or
1365.12 1366.64	collective protection level
1366.64 1368.24	it does not mean that there will be no
1368.24 1371.12	cases so if you're not vaccinated every
1371.12 1371.60	single
1371.60 1373.36	individual who is not vaccinated is
1373.36 1374.96	another
1374.96 1377.76	naive susceptible individual who then
1377.76 1379.68	can get infected by that disease
1379.68 1382.00	i think we also need to remember this is
1382.00 1383.76	covet today but there will be future
1383.76 1384.64	pandemics
1384.64 1386.48	there will be a more potent more
1386.48 1388.08	virulent disease
1388.08 1390.48	acts down the road and so i think rather
1390.48 1391.68	than thinking about let's
1391.68 1394.80	go back to life before covet i think we
1394.80 1396.64	should be thinking now about what's
1396.64 1398.32	what are the things that we have done
1398.32 1400.16	during this period that really ought to
1400.16 1401.12	be permanently
1401.12 1403.28	permanently part of our new daily
1403.28 1404.64	routines
1404.64 1407.44	and how can we raise our levels of
1407.44 1408.24	defenses
1408.24 1410.16	our levels of protection our levels of
1410.16 1412.48	hygiene so that we can be more
1412.48 1414.32	prepared and more resilient in the
1414.32 1416.32	future all right well gentlemen thank
1416.32 1417.92	you so much for coming and sharing your
1417.92 1418.88	insights on this
1418.88 1420.48	well that's all the time we have for
1420.48 1422.40	today thank you all for joining us we
1422.40 1424.00	hope we've been able to address some of
1424.00 1424.32	the
1424.32 1425.92	questions and concerns you have with
1425.92 1428.16	regard to the corvette 19 vaccines
